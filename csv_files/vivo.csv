Super vivo v17,5
"I'm a very generic user mainly using the phone for calling, clicking pics, watch movies and some apps like whatsapp, Twitter, travel booking and mails and meetings. Received the phone today and the first impression is that the phone feels light for its size, display is awesome, receptive and very smooth. Camera clicks some really good pictures and when clicked in 48MP mode, the clarity sustains even after zooming in. The charging is also pretty fast. I hope the battery life is also good. Overall, it seems a superb phone at this price point.",5
Camera average performance only night mode camera not satisfied very dark pictures it's taking..I didn't expect this fr Vivo.Battery display excellent.camera not good..Worst night mode camera.other things sounds good..,4
"Wow... As expected main camera is awesome... it's a camera centric phone so don't go for the processor it's actually runs well with Snapdragon 675
with 8GB RAM and I swear display, camera, and battery is awesome...even having 4500mah battery it's very light weight.... Over all it's perfect phone for me...Go for it if you're looking for a phone with good camera, display and battery... U'll not regret... Happy customer...
Thanks to Amazon for quick delivery...",5
good  best product,5
Very bad.please don't buy any one there is no return policy.. hurting from vivo..,1
"This Product is very good in all aspects, but the price is little higher as the processor relatively old.

Camera Quality is good
Battery Life is good
Sound Quality is normal.
Processor relatively old
Since  the Processor relatively old, the Price would have kept between 17K to 19K.",5
"Sexy model.....
About device...
 display was steals my heart
CAMERA WAS MOST HIGHLIGHT OF THE PIECE
It's about light weight mobile....
Performance was can't say jzt we have 2 feel it....

Vivo V17",5
"This product is waste it's better to go for mi or oppo or Samsung any other brand, I have used almost all brands but vivo is the worst one, it will take time to load anything you can sense it like it's lagging for example,when you open browser then it starts lagging to load the page and if you open anyone's dp in WhatsApp there also you can sense it and most important one if we are on call then you will get ear pains and headache, and I called for Amazon guys they are very worst, when I kept for replacement then they are telling these are common thing in this brand, what ever the issue if you tell them they will tell simply it's common in this brand.. the one thing little bit good is cam nothing else even it's 8gb ram it works like 2 GB ram worst phone ever I used and worst guys from Amazon, try to take it from Flipkart",2
"First look and I can't get eyes of the phone.. I don't know how many hours continuous I'm gonna play with this beauty and masterpiece
I got many suggestion not to buy this but I thought to take a risk and it worth it amazing sleek and punchy colors...",5
"Huge expectation from Vivo. But all in vain

The device had board issue and customer care tried to cheat me by asking to pay refundable deposit for board replacement, although under warranty.

The device had serious flaws and 2 software updates couldn't rectify them.

Vivo customer care asked me to take the device to service center.

Nowadays service centres are run by gangs and they demand money in pretext of refundable deposit and then once the repair is complete, they deny to pay it.

If you start a fight, in no time you will be removed from store. There are people ready to trash you up in nearby stores.

Huge problem in India, as gadgets are becoming more and more common, people are looted by thugs in various ways.",1
"I have been using this phone for past 2 months. Phone is superb. Some buyers think that it it is overpriced but it has camera features like of professional ones. It has features which we mostly don't get in smartphones of this price or a little below. Camera quality is awesome.Night mode is the main and the best feature of this phone. If you are thinking to buy it , Just buy it.",5
Super mobile excellent it was looking very beautiful I loved it super feature camera was amazing üëå all of u can buy and price as low thanks to vivo launched a great phone,5
"Although the product was good
It was having a problem
Whenever the phone was kept idle for sometime approximately 15 mins
Jio sim was becoming unreachable .
However after slightest of motion sensing call was getting connected.
And the problem remained even after swapping the vodafone and jio sim
The problem seemed to be only with jio sim and not any other sim.
The same jio sim when inserted in samsung galaxy s8 plus was working absolutely fine.",1
"This is a very nice phone. I was using Vivo V9. Some of the nice feature's of V9 is not in V17. I had expected that those feature's would also be available in V17.

On V9 when one is changing the icon pages, the page moves like ""a book page moves"" which look very nice but it is not in V17.",5
Worth of every single penny I spent on this phone.I was gonna take another phone of another brand but then my girlfriend suggested me to take this phone and trust me this is the best phone even better than any other branded phones,5
"A major disadvantage in the phone is that you can't delete the sms one time caused don't tap and select multiple sms , if you want to delete multiple sms at one time it's a sad information that you can't despite it's a vey common feature in all phones even the key pad phone too.

Camera quality is not expected as i thought before it's purchase.

Other features are good but not the cost of such expensive phone.",4
"I have been using this smartphone from the exact date on which it has been launched, i.e, on Dec 17, 2019.
Camera:
Vivo started its campaign to sell this phone stating that its camera can click pictures ""As clear as real"". Extremely disheartened from time to time from the past 02 and a half months of using it. The camera quality is worst, literally worst. I was using Sony Xperia XA Ultra Dual smartphone before this disaster came into my hand. Truly speaking, if I am going to compare the pictures, depth sensing technology, detailed visions of the pictures captured from Vivo V17, it is marked as in negative. Its so called 48 MP mode pictures started blurring when I used to zoom it. Its night mode camera is just okay. Worst in case of camera quality. It might be due to the case that I used Sony in my past. It is my urge request to everyone to please have some premium smartphone from OnePlus, or, Samsung, if you have camera in your priority bucket.

Processor:
Qualcomm Snapdragon 675 AIE octa-core at 22k budget is a moderate option. But after using from the past 02 months, it is not at all a Pubg standard game.

In-Display Fingerprint Scanning
Vivo launched this phone stating that it is Next Level In-Display Fingerprint Scanning, but truly speaking, it is not that wow. We need to deeply press the finger in order to open it.

One thing to tell is that it is not at all a good option at 20k.

Worst VIVO.",2
Fabulous phone,5
"Awesome  product  no more words but.  All things are. Best
In gaming, in camera, in music, in look
I loved it. Guys I think u should go with V 17
In 23 k Range. Tnx vivo for this üòç

The battery dint even lasted for 2 hours...
Its draining a percent  per minute just watching video on YouTube.üòîüòîüòî
The phone also don't seem to be premium at all,side buttons are loose
Can't able to think that it is a flagship phone of vivo.

Only good thing I have noticed is camera quality is good.
Requested for replacement ...",1
Average phone.  Its not value for money.  Camera is very very poor. Night mode taking seconds to take  photo but clarity is very low.  Normal camera.  I am getting better images with my realme which had half price only.  Finger sensor on the front screen is very difficult when using with one hand.  Light weight.  Display is average.  Selfie image quality is very poor.  No notch display. The free cover in the pack is useless due to  Buldged camera portion. Considering this high price the productvis waste only.,1

"After Approx 3 Weeks Of Use Here Is My Review

1.) Cost:- Pricey For Snapdragon 675 AIE Chipset, Vivo Should Start Using 7 Series Chipset Atleast.

2.) Performance :- Good For Snapdragon 675 Chipset But Let Me Inform Im Not A Gamer.

3.) Battery :- a.) Mild User - 1.5 Days Of Battery
b.) Moderate User (Like Me) - 1 Full Day.

4.) Screen :- Good ... But Struggles In Sunlight Sometimes

5.) Touch & Fingerprint :- Smooth As Hell

6.) Rear Camera :- a.) Normal Potrait Shots Are Decent
b.) Bokeh Mode - Good.
c.) 48 MP Mode - Aceeptable
d.) Macro Mode - Sorry No Yet Used.
e.) Wide Angle - Sorry Not Yet Used.
f.) Night Mode - Ok In Dark Places, But Places With Some Light ... Takes Nice Pics.

Video:- Normal - Acceptable
Slow Motion - Terrible Clearity ... A Big No-No. (1 Star Deducted For The Same)
(Will Require Update For This For SURE)

7.) Front Camera :- a.) 32 MP Normal & Bokeh Effect Are Good.
b.) Night Its Good ... If Theres Little Help With Light - Better Shots.

8.) O.S. :- Good ... But There Are Unwanted Apps Which Cant Be Removed. (Update Required For That).",4
"Don't trust Vivo......  They are having a different marketing strategy, they will give a very delicate display which you usually go within 3 months.... Which they will not cover under warranty, they will tell display damaged but mobile will have protective case everything, not even small physical damage also.....but inside display will damage because of there poor quality ...... The cost is more than 6000 rs. Depend on there model...... Even if you buy around 25-30k you will actually spend nearly 50k on this phone......... I change 3 times now, first time I thought may be some unknown damage again after 2 months it is gone again I changed, this time after 1month itself.... Gone again without any physical damage.... all these time I changed in Vivo authorized service centers only... Now I stopped to change....  I moved to different mobile ........

I enquired with friends also who bought Vivo same... Problem no one is raised the issue.....

I want to get this to public notice, so no one will fool like me.....

Think twice before purchasing Vivo mobiles.......",1
"Yes, it is delivered on mobile time.
And mobile is also very good. Very good to me

"FIRST OF ALL THIS CAM IS AWESOME. THIS CAM IS PERFECT SUITABLE FOR THIS TAG LINE AS CLEAR AS REAL.
DISPLAY WISE SUPERB BECAUSE OF SUPER AMOLED DISPLAY. BATTERY BACK UP ALSO SUPERB. I AM USING FROM LAST 2 MONTHS ON WARDS, DAILY MOBILE CONNECTED WITH WI FI WATS APP FACEBOOK VIDEOS. BUT STILL MOBILE CHARGING 45%. BATTERY WILL COME 1.5 DAYS EASILY.

CHARGING ALSO DUAL ENGINE FAST CHARGING WILL CHARGE 50 MIN.

"Fantastic phone for this price. I was not a fan of vivo till this time. I had always been a member of Nokia and was a heavy decision to come out of it. But thought of taking a chance and buying this and it did hit my expectations.
1) The camera quality is a awesome. Quality of the photos are magnificent üëå no doubt in it. Different modes in it makes it more easier to capture beautiful photos.
2) Coming to the battery. On a 100% charge it will work for more than a day like approx 30-32hrs. Trust me I charged it 100% played PuBG for like more than an hour in one sitting and still the battery doesn't drains much.
3) Graphics are fantastic. The HD screen gives fantastic graphics and Crystal clear screen. Did I mention that when you start the Pubg it automatically changes your screen resolution to HD
4) Finger print reader takes a bit of a milisecond to read and is not instant, but not a problem.
5) definitely a buy. Go for i
P.S. Type-C to USB Cable is not included in box. Attached image of box content for quick reference.",4

"I liked the product, I have been using vivo v9 since 1.5 years. Compared to that vivo v17 is not great upgrade even though it was launched in Dec 2019.

Battery: Fast charge was mentioned but trust me this is as good as vivo v9. You dont feel any fast charging , it takes 2 hrs for 100% charging.

Camera: Front cam is 32 MP compared to 24 MP of vivo v9. But quality of image is not improved much. It is as good as old v9.

Finger print: It is very good. Great response and recognition. I didnt try Face recognition till now so cant comment.

Heating: It has slight heating issue. Even old vivio v9 has similar such issue.

Audio output: This is draw back, it has decent audio output but not great sound effects.

Calling: Good clarity in voice calls.

Over all I feel its a decent mobile but not value buy at 23K if you are expecting to have good upgrade over your old vivo phone. Not many features added/improved.

By the way, I got mobile through offline retail store (glacier ice one)

Thanks.",3
