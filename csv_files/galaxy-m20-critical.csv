 Defective product received. The cell phone is hanging up again and again.i recently visited to Samsung Care Center they checked my phone and said that your phone have some sort of manufacturer default.,1
"Friends this is my feeling that more good options are available in this price-
1. display durability very poor but quality is great.
2. Camera quality is not satisfying specially front camera.
3. Low light image quality is very poor.",3
"Don't waste your money buying this phone. The camera colors the face too artificial... Even regular pics in various modes that I've tried were below average. Image quality and sharpness is much inferior even compared to what the reviews say. I didn't expect wonders from a phone of this price range, but seriously Samsung has really let me down after all the hype and brilliant marketing of M20.

Worst, the customer care just wouldn't replace or return the phone even after umpteen phone calls to their customer care and complaining about the quality, hit and miss facial recognition, pathetic camera pics under low lights.

I'd been wanting to write a review since the day it got delivered and I started testing it, but Amazon wouldn't let me put a review even after 5 days of delivery (as honest reviews like mine would impact their upcoming flash sales:)",1
"Only display quality is good,
Camara quality is bad as Samsung brand.
5000 mah battery  only named not in performance. Mi 4000 mah is better than Samsung 5000 man.
Security system is too band , my device is unlocking with out requiring password and also unlocking with non registered face I'd. It make bad experience with Samsung.
Fast charging is good.",2
Phone hangs even for few apps,1
"Don't buy Samsung galaxy M20.
Camera quality of this phone is too low not even decent. Audio and video quality is fine but volume can't up to mark. Screen quality is also not pleasant on this one.
Before buying M20 ,I think you should make a second thought if you paying 11k bucks. Device is overpriced according to its specifications.",1
"Doesn't work after update, returned phone and took 10 days for return process to take place and need to wait for another week for refund. Front camera looks like 2 megapixel.
Heavy phone, nothing great for that price.",1
Don't purchase this phone... Network frequency is very poor... Many time networks gone. And hanging prob.. Prosser is very poor,1
"I purchased this phone on the day of its sale, when there were no reviews available. I made a big mistake in trusting the brand ""Samsung"" blindly. This phone might have pros but they are nothing special. Many smaller brands also provide those features. The one particular flaw that annoyed me the most and made me write this harsh review is lack of notification LED light. This may sound simple but what it means if your phones battery is low you won't notice any warning. If you are charging your phone you don't know if its charging because there is no LED light. If you had a missed call no LED notification. If you had a text no notification. You will know all these only when you turn your screen on. So you turn your phone scree on regularly to check for all these. How the heck did they design a product like this. There are many annoying things in this phone but this one simple feature missing totally pissed me off. On top to rub salt on wounds...Amazon can't do refunds on phones which is a revelation to me. I jumped in and bought this phone in the first week and now I regret trusting Samsung. I already posted it on OLX, can't keep it. My suggestion is don't rush to buy it.",2
"1:- It's doesn't support samsung pay .
2:- Doesn't support 5G (In case you wifi have 5g option  )
3:- while recording video is keep adjusting brightness cause video quality to degrade .
4:- After 15 days of use touch is not working properly .
5:-  phone Hangs multiple times .",3
"Let's start with
(1) design was very ugly fully made out of cheap pollycarbonate easily scratch, mobile was very thick and heavy.even box quality is cheap.
(3) display was vibrant and bright no complain.
(2) Camera quality was under average clarity was missing not up to the mark.
(3) battery backup was good you will not disappoint and full charge in 2h15min
(4) Gaming was very bad in this phone heats up very quickly not able to play games like pubg even on low graphics frame dorps.

Conclusion, we all know Samsung what to give competition to other brand but they are not giving the quality which other brand gives not worth of 10990-/",1
"Please don't buy
Very poor built quality.
I tried to return mobile handset but unfortunately there is no return policy. You can only replace this.
Very disappointed with Mobile Samsung M20.
Many better options available with less price.",1
"1) Camera
A] The camera is WORST of it's kind. The blur effect/portrait (live view) just uses some Artificial Intelligence instead of using their dual lens technology completely. When you zoom the live focus pic, you can see a sharp border around the subject and rest is blurred. You can get this effect with one lens too using some applications.
B] You can only take pictures in which it detects face in live focus mode. You can't take Bokeh photos of other objects.
C] There is no EIS (Electronic Image Stabilizer) So you will get a blur bad quality photo/video if you shake the phone even a bit while taking the pic/video.
D] No 4K video recording.
E] Nothing great about front camera. Normal 8mp camera.

2) Fingerprint Sensor
A] Location - The sensor is placed much above and you will feel very difficult to reach your finger to the sensor.
B] The fingerprint sensor is too slow. C] You can not feel the sensor since it is flushed with the body and not popped out or placed a bit inside (like in Xiaomi phones).

3) Processor
A] The processor is slow compared to Snapdragon 660.
B] PUBG, Asphalt and other high end games lags when you play them on Medium and High Resolution mode.
C] Heat 🔥 If you play games continuously for an hour then the chip becomes very hot. (The chip is placed right behind the Samsung logo. So it feels like Samsung is getting hot 😂)

4) Notification Light
A] Another worst thing is missing Notification Light. You don't know whether the phone is charging, if you have any missed calls, or any message notification. Some phone with tear drop/V Notch/ Infinity display provide notification light. ( Xiaomi provides at the bottom)

5) User interface. (Samsung's 'Experience UI')
A] It makes the phone slow. Eventually it will lag much frequently.

6) Android Version
A) Comes with Android Oreo. While other phone in this segment comes with Android Pie.

7) Body
A) It's a plastic body phone. (Poly carbon)
B) Looks Cheap, Feels Cheap and is Cheap off course, compared to metallic body.

8) Updates
When I was doing research on phone, I came to know that Samsung release update too late for its phone compared to other brands. I am not sure about it.

9) It does't have Gorilla glass. But I don't know whether the glass provided is better than Gorilla glass or not. Also the glass pops a bit from the main body increases the chances to get a crack.

10) Battery
Battery is really good. Lasts for one and a half day (1.5 day) with normal usage (Not heavy gaming).

*You can't return and get the refund onces you buy the phone. Hence I have written this detailed review*
I will suggest not to buy this phone and especially don't buy phones/laptops from Amazon they don't give refund and also ask to install some app checks your phones and tells it's working fine even if it is not (Checked the Play Store reviews). Overall all worst experience with phone and Amazon.",1
"All are set in this phone....
Camera is not too good.
Live focus is not work properly
Normally all are okay.
Value for money.

Very bed phone hanging problems from 1st day of purchase and touch problems,1
Wrost phone  battery was not 5000 mah and amazon not return the phone..,1
"This mobile is only for normal use not for heavy uses like game pubg this mobile is heating and stucking when u play pubg and main problem  network issues calls coneting is good but Internet poor this mobile only for like cab porpose and delivery jobs for maps and charging capicity not for games this mobile have 4gb ram but performance  like 2gb ram don't  buy for games and internet  porpose
Good things : bettery  backup display fast charging
Bad things : processor network leggings camera quality
Go for snapdragon 625 or 626 or 636 or 660",2
Ordered on Tuesday. Got it on Thursday. Display is amazing. But battery drains like water. I called Amazon and the support guy reads a manual and tells me to use it for 48 hours more. And now I noticed something which I don't know what it is.....a blue line on the edge of the screen when looked from the top ! It's a damage I guess..  totally disappointing,1
"My mobile was heated so I dint like this product
1hr video watching heated",1
"Whereas Snapdragon 636 has 8×Kryo 260 cores clocked at up to 1.8GHz. CPU of Exynos 7904 is seeming decent than that of Snapdragon 636. Kryo 260 cores are basically is a marketing term from Qualcomm. It means four Cortex A-73 based cores and four Cortex A-53 cores. With 4 high powered cores, Snapdragon 636 can outperform Exynos 7904 with only two Cortex A-73 Cores.
I can bet Exynos 7904 cannot get a higher benchmark score than Snapdragon 636. You as a buyer can buy Snapdragon 636 powered smartphone without hesitation, If Samsung has also given 4 Cortex-A-73 cores then things might be changed.
Heating of smartphones is a notorious/crucial issue with Samsung during gaming, its all depends on poor GPU-graphics. Exynos 7904 is trying to sort out this problem using a Mali-G71MP2 GPU graphics, which is new. However, Snapdragon 636 has an Adreno 509 GPU. We do not have a smartphone powered by this new Exynos chipset.
PROCESSOR ONLY THE PRICE CHANGES.

while buying the mobile check the processor speed.
i learn from the mobile because i used before redmi note 3 this mobile faster then the Samsung galaxy m20.

please dont buy this product",1
"Received mobile yesterday..
I'm writing my review after one day usage

Very bad product from Samsung
Doesn't look like 6.3inch screen
For battery I vl give 0.5 star...bcoz Samsung said it's 5000mah battery..but after 100% charge..it's last for only 24 hrs...and limited use only...
@ 12,990 good mobiles are available..I won't recommend to buy this one...",1
"2 stars only for Amazon fast delivery.
Low camera quality

Slipy body
Low quality material
Built average
Lots of negative points...",2
Phone hang during working. Heat problem  .bad camera quality.,1
"Camera performance sub par. Battery heating up issue and overall a heavy handset. Not satisfied with the purchase.
Amazon also didn't provide the option of returning this product. Totally unhappy with Amazon service. Please don't push products to customers like this.  Return button takes you to a page, where you need to hear the usual crap from Amazon officials with no return, but only replacement option if you are dissatisfied by the performance of this product. In short, think twice before going for this product.",1
Totally time&cost waste and camera very worst then continly 3 min watching after our eyes very tired because this mobile radiation is high. I'm also samsung fan but i very disappointed. so please don't buy the Samsung m20,1
"1. Worst camera
2. Face unlock is slow and some time it's didn't work properly
3. Very weighty phone
4. Don't waste your money for 11k or 13k u have much better option are available in like  Realme U1,  Realme 2 n 2pro , Redmi phone Asus phone.
5. Battery is only good n nothing.  I have wasted my money so if you want to by give ur no.",1
Both Camera features are not satisfying much. Also result of front camera is very poor. Rest of features like battery and performance is ok.,2
"Surprised to see many 5* reviews.

My opinion is totally different than all other reviews.
Mobile has only few good things to consider for purchasing:
1.Bright Display: Not Amoled display, but looks great, but extra bright in dark night, can cause some serious issues.
2. Good battery backup of 5000 mAh, easily lasts for 1 day in average use.

Reasons not to buy:
1. Camera is just OK, not Upto mark. Though wide angle works pretty well.
2. Lags a lot.
3. Processor performance is less than Snapdragon 636.
4. Slow finger print sensor.
5. No Gaming, No PUBG.
6. Overheating while gaming.

There are many other good devices than this, unless you need only Samsung device. Like Asus zenfone Max pro m2, Redmi Note 5 Pro or if you can wait then Redmi Note 7.",1
"Mobile has big hunging problem even network is not good. Many times voice quality become very poor and many times keypad is not works
I m big fan of Samsung but this series is not good.

2. TFT display
3. Plastic or polycarbonate type body easily scratched
4. Network issue found every time
5. Very poor performance Exynos 7904 processor

"Hi, Iam Abset of Your M series becuase i Have M20 4gb/64 gb and also have M30 with 3Gb/32gb i have hanging issue's and also when play pug and high resolution game then cant work smoothly with game .  Hmmm feeling like fool becaue spent around 13k and 11 k now feelike have purchase 6k to 7 k phone",2
Not worth for the money. Camera quality is poor. Even the network connectivity is bad. Customer care executive is asking me to reset the software. Clearly a failure model and not worth for the money.,1
"Dear friends  ,,my humble suggestions  ,,plz plz plz don't buy this mobile, totally worst ,,
Only two pros in this mobile, TOUCH SCREEN DISPLAY  AND BATTERY LIFE
ALL OTHER PERFORMANCE IS WORST PLZ PLZ PLZ PLZ

CALLING SPEAKER NOT WORKING PROPERLY
LOUD SPEAKERS NOT WORKING PROPERLY
SIM CARD SWITCH FOR DATA NOT WORKING PROPERLY
INTERNET DATA IS VERY SLOW IN 4G ALSO ,EVEN SERVICES PROVIDER GIVE GOOD
WHILE TRAVELING  IN BUS CAR TRAIN ,,NETWORKS DOESN'T REFRESH SOON
IT NEEDS VERY VERY HIGH FREQUENCY TO CALL
CAMERA WORST
PLZ FRNDS ,BEFORE I AM USING  VIVO Y83 ,,COMPARE TO THAT MOBILE  ,SAMSUNG IS WORST PLZ ,don't get cheat",1
"Itz not fast charging.  Itz slow charging.  Even worse than normal charging. Waste  type ""c"" charger",1
"There is a lot of heating issue like 40 degree on video calling through any app or charging with powerbank in just 10 to 15 minutes. Network strength capacity is also weak. I wanted to return this but Amazon condition through bolancco app I couldn't replace this.
This app shows everything ok in 40 degree. How can u do this? In this temperature it's a heater😡. It is not suitable for Samsung brand. If u leave the Samsung brand then other handset is better in this range. Front camera is also not good.",1
Not good,1
"Cons:-Picture quality  is very poor.very difficult to blur background.doesnot blur subjects without face. Night shot quality  is horrible.No slowmotion,time lapse.realme U1 is much more better than so called  Samsung m20.now want to return  but can't.Totally waste my 11k.",2
"The smartphone is only has good looks, the Display is vibrant but if you install apps more than 10 or 12 it start hanging, The Exynos 7904 is showing good numbers on Antutu, but fails in real time performance and usage.
Please don't buy if you are a PUBG player.
Cons:
1. Heating very much
2. The Type C charger is also very slow the 5000mAH battery takes 2.45 minutes to full charge
3. Multitasking is poor as it get hanged",1
This phone might have good configuration under 15K segment but when it comes to performance it is below average. I have been using M20 for about 1month now and there is so much of GHOST TOUCH and screen freeze issues. Most of the time it is very annoying to use and no return or refund available. Bought this phone as a gift for my friend and total waste of money. Most of M20 users are going through the same problem. DONT BUY!!!,1
"I took day before yesterday but already charging issue came,mobile not responding to charger ....already it getting hanged....not worth for money",1
The phone gets hanged up multiple times. Tried calling customer care but they didn't allow to get replacement. They ran blancco diagnostics tool but that checks the current condition and doesn't check system logs to detect hanging issue.  They have scheduled a technician visit to check the issue but i am very disappointed with the product and replacement policy.,1
"I bought this phone believing that it's from Samsung so it must be good. However the phone only looks good. Just after playing a video for 10-15 mins the phone gets heated up so badly that you feel uncomfortable and after 30 mins it hard to hold it!!!
Battery sucks....it gets drained so very fast.. And its very annoying!! Very cheap product from such good brand.... Never expected this from Samsung!! I want my full money refunded!!",1
"I am using this phone since last few days and already given details view on my YouTube channel ""Arvin Toys Review""

My Initial observations were:

1)Regarding Nozzle Display : It's best in the market. Easily beating MI Phone
2)Touch Screen : very smooth and fast response
3)Camera : Best quality one with new features of wide angle photos. Very good quality.
4)Battery : it's having 5000mah battery but not so impressive. It's last only one day. It's performance is almost same with 4000mah battery of Redmi phone.
5)External Memory : Unlike Redmi, it has dedicated SD card slot which removed our worries about running out of storage. Another thumbs up.
5) Network Strength : it's quite disappointing. At same place with same service provider SIM, Redmi phones has more signal strength that M20.

Now after using for around 20-days, I am observing following deficiency:

1) No charging indication light
2) Notification Lights is not available
3) Head Phone is not included with the Box
4) Fast charging is not happening
5) Not able to find FM Radio Application
6) Pre-loaded security app not available.
7) Limited pre-loaded ring tones types

Overall I am quite satisfied and will recommend my friends can have a try with this one.",3
"My wrost choice ever about cellphone...
After 4 days cell goes off automatically even when charging plug out or plug-in.
Don't buy this .
Samsung & Amazon both disappointed me.
Charging very slowly
Can't play pubg with smoothness.",1
"Prns & cons :-

1):- Heating issue 👎🏻 ( no gaming, & no YouTube videos watch)

2:- battery 🔋 back was normal one day use only ( if using vdos listening 👂 music 🎧 then its normal time 5 to 7hrs only )

3:- cameras 📷 👎🏻
4:- design ok 👍🏻
5:- price 👍🏻
6:- Ni ear pods provide in the box 📦👎🏻
7:- screen touch 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
8:- finally plz wait for M 30 guys 👍🏻
Amozon No refund for this item 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻",1
"Look wise,  phone is awesome, great display but front camera is very basic and not stand anywhere when compared with MI, ViVo,  Oppo phone in this price sagment. Camera quality is not good.

Company says it has fast charging but it takes more than 2 hours to full charge it with its original charger. Extremely disappointed.

Within a week,  phone has started getting hang some time. Again Samsung has shown their incapability in managing processing speed. It's not value for money.",1
"I ordered M20 on 12 2.19, M20-4bg+64 variant, got the mobile on 13.2.19 itself. I prefer M20 only for 2 reasons. Samsung had a good brand name and it have 5000mah battery.
But, it not fulfilled my desires.
After, 3 days of usage am writing this review.
I am a normal mobile user, for me
Battery draining very fast. Think about heavy users. And for regular game players.
It's not a fast charging it takes more than 3 hrs for 0 to 100%.
Coming to RAM for 4 GB ram it's not worth. Repeatedly am facing strucking problem. While shifting to other app or tab. While gaming, typing the text, while gaming, while sliding the Facebook pages etc... I can't explain in text what I have facing here. It's not too fast for the 4gb ram. Before this I used motog3 only2gb ram its v.good performance compare to this M20.
Mobile weight also heavy, handling in single hand also difficult.
Coming to display it looks good, but it have full display upto edges in left and right sides. So we can't hold the mobile closely in left and right sides. We need to hold bottom of the mobile only. For the given weight thought to hold for a long period.
Camera Ok. Finally, Ram, battery, processor not good.
Yesterday 16.2.19 I report this problem to Amazon customer care, to return M20 mobile. But, they directed to do the hard reset. What am asking is why I need to hard reset for my new mobile .? If it had a problem , just take return it. That's ur policy mentioned also. But they are not responding properly. Think over these all. And buy it.
Most of the YouTube reviews about the Samsung M20 fails in my case.",2
"Hey m20 have arrived but the quality of box and mobile is not of samsung level. They just created a worst device. And i can say after 30 min usage. The fingerprint scanner it too much slow. Too slow. And when i carried it out of the box it was full of dirt. It feels like they have not created these series like other samsung device. How can they just put a mobile phone with lot of dust in the box and sealed it.
The ink used on the box was cheap they just provided 5000mah mah with fast charge support but didn't included any type fast charger the just provided normal charger. Very slow device. I ordered it for my father but ut has  very much small fonts, since Not impressed. The realme u1 which I have boughted a month ago from Amazon, is better than this at same price point.",3
It started hanging just after I booted the phone and got switched off....still not working since a day....very disappointed,1
"I bought Samsung M 20 set from Amazon on March 31, 2019. After 2 days, for almost 24 hours when I didn’t receive any call or mail, I checked the set and realised that the set was not functioning. When I tried to make a call following message flashed on the phone – “Not registered on network”. I tried all the possible settings/ resetting but Phone didn’t work. I requested customer care that I want to return the phone as there is some fault in the software. The executive requested me that a technician will visit my place and he shall check the set to ascertain the problem and if the problem is not solved, the set may be replaced. After 6/7 days a technician checked the phone and confirmed that there is some issue with software of the phone. He prepared a report with remark – Sim can’t be detected; customer is not satisfied and said that he shall update Amazon with the issues. Subsequently I called customer care and discussed my problem. The executive said that the technical person has close the request with remark that there is no issue with the phone and Amazon can’t help on this matter and in case I have any issue with the set, I should visit Samsung Service Centre as it is under warranty. After spending Rs. 12,999/-, now I have to visit the service centre and if the centre may come up with some new charges as they may say that visit / basic service charges is free but for any other services, I need to pay. Amazon said that they are not responsible for the set as there may be some manufacturing defect. Horrible experience with Amazon and brand new set of Samsung M 20. Need not to mention that since I travel frequently, I am taking out time to lodge complains and attend the technician during his visit. Don’t believe on the quality of Samsung M20 as well as post sale services or return policy of Amazon.",1
"Phone will disappoint you.
1. Camera -  Quality is below standard, as per samsung front camera is 8mp but it performs like 2mp , No autofocus for rear camera, poor quality photos
2. Performance - Phone get overheated when used with some heavy apps within 2 hours.
3. Battery-  battery life is long as it is 5000mah, but it makes phone heavy
4. Interface is good and smooth.

Overall it's below par as per samsung standards.
Many good options are provided at same cost in the market by competitors. Don't go for it.
And amazon customer service is worst, if you call them to complain about this they will ask you to install some kind of self-made app and then declare that your phone is working fine.",2
"Recently bought this samsung m20 product, design, phone speed everything good. But cam quality is very very poor, also it takes time between one click and another click of photos. selfie mode is too bright, unreal. apart from cam u can buy this for speed and games",3
" This is one of the worst product that you can expect from a giant player in mobile industry like Samsung , the phone started constantly hanging within 4-5 days of purchase , you can't use it for 5 minutes continuely without hanging , which makes you frustrated that you feel to crush the device or destroy it .
The phone is too heavy to handle , 186 g weight is a headache , the quality of camera picture leaves you disappointed , it doesn't have led light as well , so you have no idea about messages , calls , charging when you don't hear the sound , its strange every phone around 10k has this facility .
The only good thing about the product is its 5000 mh battery .
I would highly recommend not to buy this product .",1
"Phone Has Great Build Quality & Looks Great..
But Still Disappointed With Its Some Missing Features Which I Think Are Very Important :

1. CAMERA - POOR Picture Quality, Images Lack Details And Too Noisy. (Due to No EIS)

2. DOESN'T Have BIXBY & Samsung PAY MINI Feature On It Which Samsung provides Even In J4 & Others which are Below Rs.10000 Price Segment.

3. BATTERY Drains Sometimes Very Fast.

4. HEATING - Mobile Gets Heated Up From Back While Playing Games.

5. It Has DUAL MESSENGER NOT DUAL APPS which means You Can Use 2 Accounts For Messenger Apps Only (Like FB, WhatsApp, Etc.) Not All Other Apps.

6. Doesn't Support ""GOOGLE CAMERA"".

7. No EARPHONES & PHONE CASE in Box.
  ( Atleast Samsung Should Have Provided 1 Out of Both)

MESSAGE FOR SAMSUNG - ""Samsung, You Could Have Taken Extra Bucks But Above Metioned Features Should Not Have To Be Missed""",3
Please do not buy this phone. I personally experienced hell out of problems with this phone. You will be scared by seeing and experienving the over heated battery within 10-15 mins of continuous usage. Battery is draining like hell. Its like eye masking theory towards customers by hyping the adds in amazon. One of the worst product I have booked through amaxon.,1
Do not buy this phone. No fast charger is supplied. I was planning to return the phone but Amazon CC just refused... no option given.. don't make us fool Amazon and Samsung and all the thec gurus who gave positive review... worst phone,1
"Not for gaming like pubg, most important samsung music app could not install.  Not compatible for many apps. I bought this phone and sold on olx in between 4hours, moreover it heats up. And Amazon will not refund, i call the amazon they refuse to refund or replacement. My advice go for A or S series do not buy M series.",1
Poor camera quality,1
"I ordered this phone on its first sale that was 5th Feb,2019 and the next day I received that phone and I was very happy for it.But after using some days I realise that my handset is defective.When I was calling somebody or when somebody was calling me,maximum time we couldn't listen anyone's voice then i use different sim cards and for my doubt I reset my phone for 12 times,but yet I was suffering for that same problem then I talked to Amazon customer care and they check my phone through a software named Blancco Diagnostics. And she agreed with me after checking my device  that  I got a defective handset. Not expected from a brand like SAMSUNG,very disappointed.Today (21/02/19) I apply for its replacement (fortunately 21/02/19 was the last date for its replacement) but they told me that I'll get my refund as they don't have stock of this  product.",1
"Battery is good
Camera average
Display average
But the first and important feature of a phone is network coverage. It is very poor when I campare to other mobile and most of the time call drop or didn't get network... Bsnl and Jio.... Both sim are working good in my old smartphone and net speed is very poor plz fix this problem",2
"Really slow, wait for m30. I have made a mistake",1
Hyped up product. Never started in first place and just kept vibrating. Had to be replaced. Not sure why Amazon doesn't do their own die diligence before blinding showing up a newly launched product in their catalogue. The feedback which I got from the Amazon technician is that there are quite a few similar complaints about M20.,1
"Total Disappointment.. Waste of money.. There are better options available.. Go for that.
I had almost 120 apps installed in my previous phone. When I migrated all those apps into this phone it becomes very slow.. Almost take secs to open any app or camera.
Poor performances..
Lowlight photos are horrible especially portraits.. It gives very bad skin tone and torn pixels. It struggles to focus in moderate light.
Pro mode in camera is useless. Doesn't allow you to change the shutter n aparture.
Even after clearing the ram also performance doesn't increase. However I have more than 50% of empty memory in the phone.
It seems they have used very low quality of ram. Otherwise 4 gb ram is enough.
I'm not sure if it will perform better with only 20 apps installed.
 Good thing only is the display and the water notch display design. Which you can get in a below 10k price as well.

My review.. No.. Not at all

"😎After usage of 2 weeks...,. Am not very happy with the product... 😶

👎  primary camera is not good.... Its bluring even in morning time also... the quality of the photos below avg... Secondary camera makes above avg pictures , picture (camera photos) depth is very low compared to redmi models and other phones in the same range.

👍 Display and colour is excellent... 😍😍😍

👎 Samsung wont provide any headsets with this Mobile..

👍 Excellent Battery backup and provide fastcharging.. 😍😍😍 (no need to take any pwerbank with this product)

👎 Sound loudness little high but quality is avg.

👍 Perfomance Good, i didnt feel any lag,  i played pubg continously more than 30 minute and phone dosent hot itself..!! Battery also wont drain toomuch.

Samsung should shut the facility if, unable to deliver the quality product. Amazon needs to improve its service.",1
Worst battery life... Want to replace but amazon care didnt want to listen... Then said ye download karo.. O download karo... Heating bhi ho raha hai... And this is not my first purchase from amazon... I purshased a lot... So mai jhut kyu balu.. Ab yeh log self return karne ko bola.. Self return bhi kiya.. Pehle bola tha self return karne bad mujhe jo courier slip milega o upload karne ke bad mujhe mera replacement send kar denge seller.. Lekin aj mera product return complete ho geye lekin abhibhi seller ke taraf se mera replacement nhi aya... Na mujhe mera courier charge mila.. Worst company amazon..,1
Very poor performance pls don't buy as I was very much used Samsung mobile my whole family members used only Samsung but very sorry to say this model is worst of all previous.dont buy Amazon also will not refund in any way,1
"This is what I experienced in the past 6 months usage

Pros.. facelock lightning speed,
Fingerprint also good,
battery life good for phone calls and 4G users for one day
Camera quality is again below standard
Sound quality is Okay.

And Cons.. sub standard phone by samsung, Samsung has given up quality, backcase is made of cheap quality plastic, feels like you are handling a china handset, touch screen feel also not up to the mark, though it has 3GB ram, phone is very slow during browsing or while using internet,
Biggest drawback is that, the phone keep hanging often while using some basic functions,
Earphone not included.
Buy at your own risk...",2
Poor camera clarity then more about similar mi phones,1
"I baught it on 7th feb.
It worked well for 5 days and battery backup was excellent. But on next day i charged it full it went offff screen.
It wasn't switching ON. Neither it was charging in switch offf mode.
I went to samsung care they said its Mother Board Problem-""built in problem"" and still can't do that for free. It requires 12000 money for repair even if i hav 12 month warranty..
This is the WORST service I ever had.
I TRUSTED Samsung alot my all previous Mobiles were from Samsung only. But this M20 with great specification went totally wrong.Ill suggest everyone to wait atleast 2 months before buying new released mobiles. Even if it's Samsung Brand, wait for it , let the reviews come and then decide.
I hav worst Experience with Samsung M20 and Samsung Customer Care...Lossed 13 K on Trusted Brand.",1
"Dear Concern

I am not satisfy with the product. I am facing hanging issue (Touch is not working most of the time). To resolve that issue every time i have to press lock the screen and unlock the screen to get rid of this issue again and again.
For your kind information i am using JIO 4g on SIM 1 and Airtel 4g on SIM2. Is there any limitation or issue that i am using both the connections are 4g.
Pls. take this on high priority and resolve this issue asap.

Regards
Amit Jaggi",1
When you unlock the phone it hangs and it happened 5-6 times in a day. No matter samsung phone has 4 GB or 6 GB ram the problem by birth will not be rectified until Samsung works on it.,1
"half of ram already covered by system apps. I was using mi redmi note 4 that is much more better tehn this in everything. you cant play pubg with this one.lots of lags in graphics and game.gave u feel like you are playing on 2 gb or 3 gb ram.worst phone don't buy this.go for mi phones. I requested for return but amazon denied. and start telling stories about their policies. I will not buy anything from amazon now. heating issue is also mazor problem. you can see battery draining by small use of phone.it takes two hours for fully charge. camera is not so good. touch is also not smooth. face recognition don't work always. over all not worth.
PS: please don't buy this",1
"This is a real samsung quality phone. Heating and hanging is its hidden feature which company will never tell u,u have to know urself.dont buy anymore.tHis is most best worst product i buy.",1
"For the first time I changed the phone brand ever since I started using smartphones, and I must say I am regretting it big time. I was a Moto User for last 5 years and I changed to Samsung since didnt want to use oppo/vivo/mi crap and was pissed of nothing new in Moto's new versions. We may be far from Self-driving cars, but Samsung has given me self-operating phone. The screen starts zooming in and out at the speed of 20 per second at any time . Sometimes it starts self-operating madly at bullet speed without any sense. Mediocre camera, 4th class fingerprint sensor, fast charging that happens for 2-6 hours invariably for a full charge, the more you curse, lesser it is. Bloody cant throw also since EMI is there for 4 months to bite and suck. I swear will sell it the day EMI finishes.",1
"my opinion
1.display is so good
2.signal reception is good
3.phone works great for normal use ( browsing and watching videos)
4.battery lasts 1.5 days ( atleast for me )
5.fast charging really helps me
6.camera is not good
7.only 3 finger finger prints can be registered
8. didn't enjoyed much while playing games with this
9. software needs improvement in lots of area
10. build quality is just okay",3
"Hello everyone,
Firstly I have to mention that received the worst customer service from the Amazon team. I have ordered for charcoal black, however I have received ocean blue mobile. When I raised the concern the amazon team told me they will not be able to replace instead I have to get in touch with Samsung service centre.

In terms of mobile, the features are good. However I am facing battery draining and heat issue. Hence I am not even getting a day of charge.",1
"Brought the M20 last March, it was very good in the beginning weeks, as the days progressed, in the 2nd month, the battery is taking longer time to charge, the charge was 4% when I plugged it in charger, I checked regularly and after 6 hours, the charge was only 74%. I shifted the mobile to another fast charger which I got with Huawei Honor Play mobile, in 10 mins, the charge jumped from 74% to 84%. I guess, the charger they are supplying is not matching with the phone level.

Face recognition is horrible, it is identifying bother mother & daughter faces as one, my daughter can unlock my wife's mobile with face recognition in atleast 5 attempts. Camera is average.

I went with samsung, cause had trust in a reputed brand and also brought earlier phones from Samsung, but, since they had brought the phone with so many features in less cost, they seems to have reduced the durability of these important parts that make up the mobile, hence this mobile is almost equal to china mobile. Go with high end models than this one. Cheers!!",3
"Front camera is so bad.
Worst camera both in th range of 10k - 15k.
Redmi Note 3 camera far better then M20.
Don't buy this phone on Amazon.
They don't have refund policy.
Samsung M20 is just a hype.
Please check this phone offline first then take risk to buy.
This is just misleading to customer through advertising.",1
"If you are planning to buy this mobile, then read this & then decide for yourself.
I bought the Samsung m20 in, using it from last 2 weeks.

As Samsung launched such mobile first time at this competitive price, expected many things.
Pros:
1. Samsung branding.
2.5000 mAh battery: With moderate usage, it will last for more than a day. ( with 7-8 hours Screen On Time)
3.Type C support.
4.Cheap

Cons:
1. PUBG works in medium settings, but after 20 minutes mobile starts heating, same in case of Asphalt 9.
2. Though it supports Fast charging, still takes 2 & half hours to charge fully.
3. The processor is Exynos 7904, which is less powerful than Snapdragon 636.
4. The phone gets overheated if we watch youtube or in memory movies more than 40 to 50 mins
5. No notification LED.
6. Lags while multitasking, it takes few seconds to load the app.
7. Auto brightness doesn't work properly.
8. Camera quality is very poor. Painting effect is more in photos if we zoom.
9. Finger Print sensor is not effective and takes time to unlock mobile.
10. Even Face recognition is not good enough, It works 3/10 attempts.",1
recieved damaged product,1
"Beware !! Screen got blacked out after using for an hour , not able to do anything calls are coming but not able to pick ‘em up as there’s nothing on the screen and moreover its speaker is also not working properly during calls",1
I've ordered this Samsung Galaxy M20 on 5th Feb and it got delivered to me on 6th. Till 9 days its overall performance was good and finally I was satisfied I have got a good one. On 15th Feb night suddenly display is behaving indifferently and it was calling on its own and opening apps randomly. It did happen quiet a few times after that and I have contacted Amazon center where they did a blancto app display test and it failed. Then they provided me a new one on 17th Feb. Ordering a newly launched mobile on the first day of launch and getting a manufacturing defect from SAMSUNG doesn't look good at all. Hope the new one works good otherwise I will change the brand and go for different one if I need to replace again. Time consuming shhhhhhhhhhhhhhabba!!,3
It says that we get an in box fast charging adapter of 15W but it was a regular 10W charger inside. Seriously didn't expect this from Samsung. How can a regular 10W charger charge 5000mAH battery quickly?,2
"Back cam is not working, giving error continuously while operating cam. Even front cam quality is not good. Even Amazon took 12 days to initiate refund, worst service by Amazon Finally #IMDisappointed",1
"1) Camera
A] The camera is WORST of it's kind. The blur effect/portrait (live view) just uses some Artificial Intelligence instead of using their dual lens technology completely. When you zoom the live focus pic, you can see a sharp border around the subject and rest is blurred. You can get this effect with one lens too using some applications.
B] You can only take pictures in which it detects face in live focus mode. You can't take Bokeh photos of other objects.
C] There is no EIS (Electronic Image Stabilizer) So you will get a blur bad quality photo/video if you shake the phone even a bit while taking the pic/video.
D] No 4K video recording.
E] Nothing great about front camera. Normal 8mp camera.

2) Fingerprint Sensor
A] Location - The sensor is placed much above and you will feel very difficult to reach your finger to the sensor.
B] The fingerprint sensor is too slow. C] You can not feel the sensor since it is flushed with the body and not popped out or placed a bit inside (like in Xiaomi phones).

3) Processor
A] The processor is slow compared to Snapdragon 660.
B] PUBG, Asphalt and other high end games lags when you play them on Medium and High Resolution mode.
C] Heat 🔥 If you play games continuously for an hour then the chip becomes very hot. (The chip is placed right behind the Samsung logo. So it feels like Samsung is getting hot 😂)

4) Notification Light
A] Another worst thing is missing Notification Light. You don't know whether the phone is charging, if you have any missed calls, or any message notification. Some phone with tear drop/V Notch/ Infinity display provide notification light. ( Xiaomi provides at the bottom)

5) User interface. (Samsung's 'Experience UI')
A] It makes the phone slow. Eventually it will lag much frequently.

6) Android Version
A) Comes with Android Oreo. While other phone in this segment comes with Android Pie.

7) Body
A) It's a plastic body phone. (Poly carbon)
B) Looks Cheap, Feels Cheap and is Cheap off course, compared to metallic body.

8) Updates
When I was doing research on phone, I came to know that Samsung release update too late for its phone compared to other brands. I am not sure about it.",1
"Dear Samsung Team, i was not happy to purchase SAMSUNG PHONE due to bad experience in past, but the price of phone and features you are providing was force me to test one more time, but there is not change in performance, there is problem of hanging phone a lot i just purchased M30 one month before with 4/64 configuration i m failed to proper work. earlier was used MI phones since last 3-4 year but not a single time i was found such problems. Too Much Hanginggg",1
"I bought this product in the first lightening deal trusting Samsung brand. But disappointing. The product do not update over wifi. No apps can be installed over wifi. The battery is draining too fast , at the rate of 10% on 10 minutes. I have been behind these issues for two weeks now. Amazon service engineer came to my house finally and certified that it has all these problem. However Amazon is not ready to refund or allow me purchase another phone with whatever I paid. They say their policy do not allow it. The built quality of the phone and color is also worst.  Please dont get trapped.",1
"I bought this phone on 14th February. Everything about the phone is disappointing. Fast charging??  The phone takes 4 hours to charge 50 percent.
The touch sensitivity is horrible. It takes 4 touches for a single action.
Apps keep on opening by themselves. Leave the phone unlocked and just watch. It sends messages, calls random people from your contacts all by itself.

The only good thing about this is that Asphalt plays well.",1
"Most important *never purchase product from amazone* in my Samsung phone amazone show return nd replace policy but when I demand for return amazone care person said we r not return our product at any cost.what you want you have to do.
So pls don't buy from amazone
Product quality not as per expectation
Picture quality is not good
Samsung is a good brand I am not expect chip quality  from Samsung.
If I compare camera quality with oppo nd vivo there is a big difference between Samsung nd oppo ,vivo.
Oppo vivo camera quality is so good.
Mob no 8005541049",1
"Pro_
1. Great battery. It will perform more efficient after disabling preinstalled samsung app. Charging speed is also good.
2. Big FHD screen. U will enjoy games and videos. U will feel something different and classy than other phones in this range while seeing screen. Full marks for screen.
3. Wide lense camera which u cant see in most of competitive phones. (i dont know have many of u will take wide angle pics. lol)

Cons.
Big issue with camera. when it comes to Facial pics, after disabling beauty mode it takes unreal washed beauty pics. very artificial. NO NATURAL PICS.

1. I felt battery heating issue. serious heating issue while playing PUB G
2. Low light camera performance is worst.
3. No blur effect control. Apne marji ka malik h camera. Jaha chahe waha blur marega
4. You cant take bokeh shot when face is not in frame. u always have to look into camera. Strange
5. Frame drops in HD Pub G gaming. (Even Nokia 5.1 plus with 3 gb ram performs better in HD setting)
6. believe me my 4 years old moto G2 is having better sound than this. Dolby sound doents makes any major difference.
7. Audio recording in singing app like smule is worst.

Overall, On paper and reality is far different.
What a bad day i purchased this phone instead of Nokia 6.1 Plus",1
No Samung health and padometer.,1
i had purches this phone for my wife as gift but when she open and switch on the open a yellowes patch on the screen.  it was very devastating so i returned that phone and i was very glad they return the phone immediately.,1
"1-Charging takes 5-6 hours for 0-100 %.Bought new fast charging cable but problem was not solved.Amazon executive advised to contact service centre. No refund and replacement period is just 10 days.Problem started after 15-20 days.
2- 3.5 mm earphone did not work properly and  my brand new earphones got damaged one after another.
3-Wide angle camera quality is acceptable only in broad day light under sun only
4- Blur effect never worked properly because there is no depth sensing camera.2Nd cam works separately as wide angle cam without zoom without video recording
5-Absence of notification led. It became very important during charging problems
6-I bought samsung after 11 years and regrets",1
"It's the worst phone in this price range.
Not expecting the worst quality from Samsung, camera quality worst then redmi note6.
battery performance is not up to the discription drain within 24hrs.
too much of unnecessary Samsung apps which eats more battery.
the processor is not great, not even the screen lock
overall performance 4 out of 10.
As per my suggestion plz don't buy this phone you will get far better phones in this price range.
kindly wait for the redmi note7
or buy redmi note6",1
"Sir, We get this phone (Samsung Galaxy M 20) on 17-feb-2019. When I received the phone and I on the phone it was worked only 5 minutes then immediately it was switchoff. Then onwards it was not working/on. Please rectify the problem immediately. Thanking you, sir.",1
"Don't fall for the advertisements which I did, thinking that Samsung in trying hard to do good in this price segment with so many features at this price-point. Let's see the pros and cons and I shall leave the rest to you...

Pros: Now that I have started to write the plus points I find that this phone doesn't have anything exceptional to offer at this price point which other manufacturers like Huewi, Mi, Realme are not offering.  Full screen 6.3 inch with teardrop notch, Dual Camera, 5000mAh battery, fast charging with usb type-C, Low radiation are the plus points much touted by Samsung.

Cons:
1. Dual camera system is a complete joke. 13 MP primary camera is just average. 5 MP wide angle captures are grainy. Lowlight capabilities are minimal. Pro mode is another joke.
2. Phone heats up considerably when playing games like PUBG
3. For a 5000 mAh battery day to day performance is rather poor. Lasts only a day on more than average use, which other phones last with 3500mAh battery.
4. Fast charging is not fast at all, requires more than 2 hrs to charge fully.
5. Fingerprint sensor feels like still in its fast generation. Slow, inappropriate, problematic. Face unlock is another disappointment.

Well that's more or less it.. Decision is yours 🙂",3
"I am providing review after using it for 6 months. Mobile was good to use with good screen and speed. But the Issue is Mobile is not durable. My mobile screen stopped working(getting heavy blurred lines) after 6 months. I know other people who has same problem(dark spots) on screen. Samsung service center says, mobile gets damaged with Body sweat and Rain Moisture. Unhappy to buy this product, Samsung does not provide warranty.",2
"This is a moderately priced mobile phone from Samsung. Phone is ok for normal users.  No problem with battery life. But, it takes more than 3 hours to 100% charge from around 10%. This is unusual for a new generation phone. Camera is average, but not very bad. Once again an ok only. Camera app has started giving problems already. It takes very long time to open or it will not open. May be an issue with software.  When the phone is switched off and restarted phone becomes ok. Similar problem I am facing with Amazon app too. Finger print sensor is ok. At times it misses. Display is ok. Adaptive brightness is not working properly several times. Samsung as usual has loaded the phone with their apps,  which may not be liked by all. If you are a pure android lover, you may not like this one. Except battery life, which is lasting for more than a day for emails, WhatsApp and other regular usage (no games), one can not expect more from this phone. Overall the phone is a very average product in my opinion.",3
"Pros:
Battery life
Ream camera (portrait mode)
Face recognition & finger print

Cons:
Heats up in 10-15 min, especially if you are on calk without headset.
Screentouch malfunction every now and then.
Freezes every now and then.

P.S: Dear Samsung, Phone is a essential part of living these day, so you cant make defective products and expect customers to do the beta testing for you. You cant get away with ""If you have an issue, please contact our customers support"" bcoz most of us don't have the time to waste on customer support, no one wants to submit their phone, and wait for 10days to get it fixed, that is why we opt for international brands over local brands. Its better you charge a few extra bucks rather than launching a product without testing. I mean... I cant talk to anyone for 10mins without headsets, my ears starts burning, i mean the primary use of a phone is to call, if you cant do that what good is a phone for? and of course your reputation of phone blasts are still fresh in our memories.",1
"It's a worthless phone with only dislikes. It get hang freequently. Auto brightness is not working properly.
The product is not up to the mark, the built quality, the resolution and the best part is the the camera is even worse.
The dual camera is for name sake and you end up having pathetic pictures. It's best to have some different category phone for the same price brand rather than going for M20.
Also please note Amazon is not providing any service to return the product.
They are just over promoting and overhyped the product to catch the customers in the net. Once it's sold as per them, they can't help.

If you one ask me then i would not suggest to go for it.",1
Still have hanging problems from the first day. Still need improvement even after 4/64. I will recommend if you are going to buy a phone of up to 15k then dont buy this product. (Camera is not working so cancel my order but it's a secondary problem),1
"Battery backup is good but very heavy product. Display quality,camera not as per expectation  compare to other new brands in market,Samsung need to focus this for future launch of budget range. Android 8.1 Oreo full of ad, require all permission on for running apps.better go for IOS.Only brand loyal can go for this phone in very competitive market of mobile phone.Samsung not confirm for android new version  pie updates.",3
"I am a huge Samsung fan and even though my son told me that there were far better products in the Market in this price bracket, my brand loyalty made me go for the Samsung M20 (4+64 GB).
Sadly, my son was right and I am completely disappointed with the phone's performance.
I am a senior citizen and use the phone very sparingly. I do not use YouTube or watch movies or use any other streaming services. I have downloaded just a few food delivery apps and check my WA messages a couple of times a day...that is all!
In spite of minimal usage, the phone Hangs continuously and the screen freezes for a couple of seconds. This happens, even if I am checking my sms messages. I cannot begin to tell you how frustrating this problem can be.
Now that I have bought the phone, I have to live with the problem, but strongly suggest one looks elsewhere for much better quality and value.",2
"Had ordered the phone even after everyone told me not to (because of Samsung phones' perennial hanging problem). I ordered because I thought it used to be a problem with Samsung phones but they might have fixed it by now.

This was the biggest mistake I made. Total wastage of money on this pathetic phone. It's not working at all after just 6 months. There is a blank screen repeatedly which comes up randomly. Even all the apps are just closing randomly.

Checked for battery problem as well as memory issues, but nothing there. There is hence a manufacturing defect.",1
"The phone is no doubt good as per the price. Face recognition is very slow and doesn't work at times. Asks for several update. Camera quality is ok. Doest hang as if now.
Pathetic service from Amazon. I called the delivery guy for the timings but he said he gave the phone to a friend and he will deliver the next day. Amazon didn't have any clue about nor had any details of the 2nd delivery guy. It was a gift for my mother and they completely ruined it. Also when the unknown delivery guy came he rang my bell 5-6 times continuously and didn't even ask for the security PIN and just handed me the phone.
I would request to directly guy it from the store instead of getting into so much mess.",2
"I have a very softcorner for Samsung in terms of innovations and technology but I can't believe Samsung is doing such things by launching M10 & M20 under the banner "" only for Indians "". Picture quality and performance is way bad. The said battery life of 5000mah is way bad than 4000mah of other brands. Overall, I feel for the first time that I am being fooled by Samsung and on the whole we Indians are being fooled by Samsung. Their is no need of any star for this product but I personally have a soft corner for Samsung in terms of innovations and technology so a single star is more than enough to express my dissatisfaction for this particular product M10 & M20.",1
"The grainy photos will bring disappointment. I wanted to return, but got to know that there are no returns for mobiles on Amazon.

Doesn't live up to the Samsung reputation in the camera department. Realme does a better job!",3
"The camera is good. Touch screen response is fabulous. Notification light is missing.  Few more apps like samsung switch, auto zipping of unused app, should have been preloaded. The charging cable length is not a standard one. Cost cutting? No headphone is provided. No built in antena for FM radio. Even the the phones in the price band of Rs1500/- do have built in antena for FM radio. Surprises why Samsung not included in this M20 variant.",3
"What I Like:

Battery
Display
Performance
Fingerprint scanner: It's really fast.

What I didn't like:

- Face recognition: Very hard to unlock in low light. It’s USELESS.
- Back panel: Doesn't look attractive. It's plastic.
- Weight: Feels a bit heavy. (Well there is a 5000 mah battery fitted inside this machine. You have to compromise)

CAMERA is average. Mi and Realme phones in this price range have better camera quality.

Endnote: If you are a die hard Samsung user then this  is the phone you should buy around Rs 10,000 - 14000. This phone is not what you are expecting it to be like previous Samsung phones - J series, ON series. M series phones have comparatively better performance and battery life.
But I would recommend you to buy a Redmi phone (Note 7 series) or a Realme phone in this price range. Samsung is still struggling in budget phones.",3
"The Phone has good look thats all.
Cam is pathetic if not more.. In this era of Cam phones.. lagging by miles
The charger is a C type but not a fast charger by any means.
The finger print reader is far too up n u have to really reach for it.
Face Recognition is far from okay also.
Phone hangs a bit.
Though only for 12k but doesn't really justify it.

A 2 starer overall.

After 4 months of use.. 1 star.. can't even compare to Vivo n Oppo.. in same range...

Money wastage.. totally

Now not even worth one 🌟",1
"I am writing this review after 1week usage of samsung m20.
PROS:
1. The screen quality is superb nice display.
2. Battery is good, I am charging two days once only. Charging timing lease than 3 hrs.
3. We have larger storage 32gb which is more than enough for me.
4. Very light even 5000 mah battery.
CONS.
1. First the camera is not expected level, low light
Photos are very average quality, overall it’s a decent, if you are a camera lover then it’s not your choice.
2. Sound volume is very slow, it can be little louder.
Overall performance is good.

The package was not good previously they have used cotton boxes for the mobiles phones, but now a days they simply packed with cover only, which is bad, we never expect from amazon.",3
"If you are planning to buy this phone please consider these things, These are my observations.
Pros:
Display is good
Battery is good
Provided fast charger in the box and usb type c
These are the only positive points I find in this device.
Cons:
1. Finger print is bad very slow and failed to recognise sometimes, I turned finger print off all the time
2. User interface feels slow day to day usage is not that great even though it is new phone it feels slow I don't know it will after 1 year. Redmi devices are way better in this department
3. If you want to play PUBG stay away from this phone.",3
"Pros:
1. Gorgeous display FHD+, the only point to love this phone at this price.
2. Update to One UI, great Ui to interact with.
3. Mobile design looks premium, actually better than what in photos. I ordered a black which has a shiny look to it. So great job Samsung.
4.5000MAH battery, although draining is little fast like 1 HR of casual browsing brings down from 99% to 82%.

Cons:
1. Camera is just not ok. The camera interface is good but their is a great lag in image processing. U will get hazy and washed out images and distortion is common on zoom. May be upgrade to M30 would be a better option, don’t know?
2. Fingerprint sensor is a nightmare! Bad placement in such a huge phone and sensitivity is crab!
3. ScreenTouch proximity is low. Like if u have used a high end phone u I’ll feel the difference.
4. The shocking one is the sound which is really low. Just one down firing speaker for output, If blocked by any mean, may God help u in receiving the call.
5. Price is little high compared to it’s competitors.

About speed, didn’t find any lags. Galaxy store app(pre installed) will cheat u by automatic installing unwanted and nonproductive apps even u disabled the download option.

Overall:
It is the best display phone in this price with Samsung’s One UI support. But certainly need improvements in camera sensors, speaker quality, fingerprint sensor!",3
"Fingerprints is ok but sometimes its can't read n says its dirty so clean it
Camera quality is up to the mark but not fully satisfied with DSLR blur effect bec its has certain minimum range to capture with this effect
Battery life is truly good I'm m satisfy if fully charge it gives full backup upto 8 to 10 hours with remaining 30% to 40 % back
The screen protector inbuilt appy by Samsung is not good it's not scratch proof so it's not fully protect your screen from damage you have to appy some extra from market for better protection
Samsung work great hear but they are not totally satisfy to customer as my personal experience they give dev drop display but is just for good looking not useful while watching videos its can't use full screen compare to real me mobile phone they have option to hide or display notch while playing videos or other thing Samsung gives it only for applications for full screen or hide notch",3
"1-Camera quality is average.
2-battery backup is great.
3-now fast charging is taking more time as comparison to first 5 days.
4- best looking phone.
5-finger and face unlock is slow compare to other phones
6- type c charging port is plus point in this segment.

Overall if u r samaung fan so u can buy it but if u wanna spend ur money for excellent device so better go for xiaomi",3
"Samsung is alright at higher range. It has spent last few years competing with Apple. Now after a while its just trying to get its act together. There are better products out there. UI is thoroughly monetized. Worst than google. You have to dwell deep to disable some of their pesky ads. Seems Samsung is dying, just seems this is their last straw. Hardware is noting to write about. Got a big battery but because of the UI it just does not work.
Both LG and Samsung where good at making screens. They could have harnessed that but don't know the strategy is now days...be stupid...or stupider...",3
"Daily task ok.
Good screen.
Very very good for videos.

Very very bad camera. Like my previous 6k android phone.
Heavy. After 30 minutes hands feels pain.
Battery drain faster. In night it drain 3% means 150mh. where as my previous phone as drain 3% means 75mh. I think its Processor takes much power then other.
Edit- after software update camera quality improve.",3
"This phone got old processer having heating problem, if you are playing any game please put gloves to protect your hands from scorching...This much MAH battery is of no use which drains rapidly while using heavy applications...screen is not optimized and if in a day you are using it screen drain your battery to 60-70%. but if you are not using it for heavy uses than phne is good and really does make sense to spend 15000 if you are not going to use it heavily.
Camera:- Photo taken using this camera are really fabricated..its like i am the eighth wonder of the world...Camera is not capturing anything real. picture taken is projected to high light leaving all natural effect. i am an average looking person but photos taken using this camera are like i am the most handsome guy.",2
"it is frequently hanging for even phone calls.  forget about any app opening, i could not complete my many phone calls due to hanging during lifting the phone itself. i did not see this type of worst phone for 10000 segment. there is no point  in calling this as a phone as we cannot receive the phone calls due to hanging during lifting the call. I lost the faith  on samsung company itself. Even I thought of purchasing M30S by exchange this phone, however, that is also having similar processor. i have gone through so many reviews and experts suggesting that this phone is not suitable for gaming. the experts review is proven wrong that this is not even suitable for receiving the phone calls itself.",1
"Why you to NOT buy this phone.
1.both camera are very very bad as comparing to other phones which is coming from this price segments.
2. Very very bad performance you can't able to play pubg in low setting. Its lagging every time.
3. Loudspeaker sound was very very low. Seriously these are major three ISSUED with this phone ..",3
"Reviewing after 3+ months of daily use.
This phone is beautiful in the first look.
But as you use it you all come to know that this phone is only about display and battery.
The phone lags often and responsiveness is very bad when some apps are open in the backgroung.
I have used MI phones of the same price range and they are way better.
Fingerprint unlock takes 1 sec+ if the phone has been in sleep for some time. Is very annoying.
Camera quality is bad as well. Works good only of lighting is better.
If you love the brand Samsung, then go for it. But for everyone else, there are other better options.",3
"Well, the good things are all out there, so no need to mention them. But a few problems I am facing right now are
1. Brightness sensor is very disappointing and moody.
2. Touch on the edges is a little problematic.
3. Fingerprint sensor placement is not very comfortable, although sensor works satisfactorily.
4. Not for gamers.
5. Lags a bit while changing in between multitasking tabs.
6. Body is very prone to fingerprints and scratches.
Well, in some cases only my piece might be at fault but, most of them are very common problems among the handset majority of customers are facing.
=> Battery life is very good and lasts for about 24 to 36 hours on moderate usage.
=> Camera is satisfactory, although there are better versions available in same price range.
=> Looks are very good and it looks great and is very comfortable to handle.
Note: PUBG does not work properly, and lags a lot. So, PUBG players should avoid buying this handset or heavy gamers in general.
 Phone is good for day to day operations and is good for working people.",3
"Fingerprint reader -  reader is not fast enough and also it read when you put your finger cover reader.

Front camera - worse than that i expected.

Rear camera - satisfying  but not too much. And some time its go blur too much.

This mobile screen freeze  sometimes  and that so irritating.

Battery  life - Samsung  promises battery  life  uninterrupted  when you play video 2 days but it too short and low battery.

Network strength - This Mobile  is compatible with 4g lte system but this phone not have some lte bands missing because 4g, 4g volte ,hspa(3g)  network only one bar strength  see in my Samsung  m20  charcoal  black.

Another problem  is internet  access of data cut out during the incoming  and  outgoing  calls .whenever in other competitor  like redmi note 5 pro you can run youtube during talk to your loveones .

This Mobile have PLS TFT screen not even good as led screen .

Currently i am so much suffering  from  anxiety  due to brought this phone by 2 month and i am really so disappointed Samsung.

When i was going to buy this phone my friend  said please dont buy Samsung  phone because they are hangs and freeze quiet a lot but i dont hear a one word and buy it but i am so feel short between them.",3
"I bought this phone for my Dad.. overall the phone is ok.. it's not fit for the young peoples who spend much time in games and online
Battery life: I'm using one 6 which had a battery life of 3000 mah.. it's similar to this.. but its mentioned as 5000 mah.

Camera: Evan Samsung j7 camera quality is... Better.. than.. this.. rear camera is good.. but front cam is.. worst.. compared to others..

Sound quality: it's good.

Overall the phone is ok.. for my Dad.. this review is as per me... But battery and cam it Should be viewed seriously",3
"For the first time amazon disappointed me. After, the delivery of the phone and usage i was not satisfied by and the camera quality and laginess of the phone i wanted to return the phone within the return period as they mentioned that the phone is returnable. I was tension free, but when i tried to place the return request I was unable to do this.then I called on customer care but what they said is you are required to download a testing app from Samsung and if the app test results in any error or problem only then we can return the phone and friends camera issue and laginess of the phone was never detectable by the testing app. So be carefully if you order this phone then remember that they are saying return policy but the phone is not returnable until any hardware problem.",2
"Samsung M20 offers a decently high battery.Although not a perfect 5000 Mah battery .Lasts about a day with medium to high usage. Although the ram is 4 gb, Apps take a while to open and close which is a major setback of this phone. Processing speed is also quite slow which is again a setback .User interface is very nice ,better than Xiaomi at least because it doesn’t have annoying ads .Camera is fairly good for its specification for it can take moderate photographs with average sharpness and resolution.",3
"This is updated review after 8months of use.
Now Frequently It gets stuck/hang.
The touchscreen had become less responsive and i have to face problem while receiving the call and also while stoping reminder bells.

Following is old review which is valid even today.
Selfy is very bad.
Rear Camera is average. Many times image appear like painting.it does not  focus the image accurately.
 display is average, white light is emitted when we view the screen at flatter angle.
Touch is not sensitive, its slow and many time it does not work.
Similarly finger print sensor is very slow and we have to touch the sensor at particular angle.

Battery stamina is good.
It camera captures almost original color.
Voice quality is good.",1
"@WHEN RECEIVED NEW DEVICE@
when I removed the plastic over the mobile. it was feeling like some repair work done on mobile.
when I checked properly, I found a big gap between the display and plastic body. I can see the internal part of the mobile. (YOU CAN SEE IN THE PHOTOS)
also, the screen auto-lock is too slow. it's irritating.

@WHEN RECEIVED REPLACED DEVICE@
the rare camera got the hang.
the front camera got to hang.
front face lock was not working.
when Amazon tested with their BLANCOO App bot camera failed in the test. (YOU CAN SEE IN THE PHOTO)

whenever I ordered in Amazon offer, i received a product like that. indian government should think about this website.",1
"Pro:
1. The display of the phone is really good, fingerprint n face recognition are quite fast.
2. The rear camera does pretty good with wide angle.
3. Battery is massive.
4. Sound quality is good and pretty loud.
5. Type c charging for this price n brand is attractive n does decently.
Cons:
1. Front camera is disappointing or should I say depressing 😖😢
  Rear wide angle camera when used, Looks like fish eye effect at the edges.
2. Bad call quality, call could be over heard. Was confused if the loudspeaker was on😠
3. Faced a glitch while switching between apps.
4. Charging from 20% to 100% took 2hours🙄
  Only till 50% its charging faster..after that
  it's a tortoise race.
5. Bluetooth did not connect to my bluetooth speaker or headphones.",3
"The phone is working fine. Very happy with the battery performance. The mobile is not heating much  even after prolonged use. The camera performance is just ok can not be called great as true colors are not being captured.
Unable to set the theme of my choice and forcefully making me to accept default wallpaper.

Antenna is poor, I have to always go to a window at home or office to talk.

Another issue, the phone gets into silent mode on it's own and due which I miss many calls.

The biggest disadvantage is the ads. First, I have to unlock the phone to receive a call. As soon as I unlock an ad pops up covering the entire screen and sometimes before I locate the close button to close the ad, the call gets disconnected. To disconnect a call also I have to deal with ads.
Samsung should do something to stop these  ads they are very annoying as they just pop up everywhere. Also these ads eats into my data.",3
"Design - Front look is very attractive, back side just Ok

Face recognition and sensor - good

Battery - doesn’t seem 5000 mah, will not last for 1 day use

Camera - quality average

Speed - just OK

Not recommended for gamers and those fond of taking pictures.",3
"After using it for 5 months, I realised that it's an Average phone.
The phone in blue looks good,  it's sleek and light. Got a fantastic battery life and didn't hang all these 5 months.
Never used this phone for gaming so I don't know if it's good for heavy use.
BAD is the only word for its camera. Even though it has a Wide Angle View, the photo quality is 'Average' for Rear Camera and 'Very Bad' for Front Camera.
The phone is for only good enough for calling and messaging. Rs. 9990 mein itna hi milega.

My review is based while comparing with my previous phone,  which was a Lenovo Z-2 Series.",3
"Galaxy M20 is overall good deal to buy, fingers scanner work quickly.
Camera performance is not as my expectations it's not capture the natural colours, wide angle camera performance is same as normal one, live focus is doing great job focus is not loose while making a video.
I'm totally impressed with the battery life and M20 support of fast changing and you can save your battery life by using night mode and power mode.
The one thing which give it bad impression is gaming, if you're a heavy gamer you'll disappointed with the performance, when I play Asphalt 9 mobile start overheating and the application crash itself, it's really a big issue for any mobile gaming lover.
I'll give it 3.5 stars for the overall usability.",3
"Mobile is very good but camera so cheap really
I have 4 mobiles but this one of worst camera. Don't know why after huge profit why Samsung can't give complete perfect mobile, every time kahi to Kam dega hi.
Why camera quality is bad ? Due to policy can't return now. It's bad deal this time.
Amazon delivery superb but still not happy that much for camera and sound quality.

"Very worst service.. I thought Amazon is good.. Worst seller. all defective parts.  Didnt expect this.. fed up completely. tried n no of times samsung as well as amazon customer care.. Oopppsss.. no response from both. I was using samsung for the past 4 years. No complaints. such a nice mobile. That's y I believed that brand and bought this worst mobile. Now the standard of samsung becomes very worst.. worst service centers..my suggestion don't go for samsung pls... i m facing many hardware issue within 1 day.. too bad... I have wasted Rs. 11,000 on this.

customer service person disconnecting my call very very very worst .........................",1
"After using Redmi phones for over three years and having been a user of Samsung mobiles before that, I can say that samsung has done nothing, absolutely nothing since last 4 to 5 years in the UI department. Feels like using a primitive device.

Apart from that, RAM optimization isn't very good. The phone lags sometimes even while using some lightweight apps. The cameras, especially the wide angle one, isn't worthy of even a mention. The only positives are screen and battery life. I don't see myself using this phone for more than a few months.",3
"My family has been using Samsung for 20 years and never we have come across such a phone. I got this for my mom and it doesn't work. The phone keeps on hanging, the touch is so poor that when you are something on the phone the keyboard will open on it's own and start typing things.. The screen keeps on dancing all the time that we have to switch it off and again switch on. When you are talking to someone on call, the phone again gets hanged and you can't hear anything what the person on the other side is saying. Reported this issue to customer care, they said that there was a bug in the software which will be gone once they launch an software update but even after the new software update the phone is still the same.  Very disappointing performance. All in all, it's not worth anything",1
"Display
Display quality is below average .shows more bluish colour and fuzzy text and low contrast in night.night light is not adjustable.

Camera
Camera is also very weak worst dynamic range and oversampled looking images.
Metering is also bad.
 overall camera is not decent
Headphone output is very soft and not pleasing.
After a month it shattered badly and worst kind of when it's drop just over a feet .",1
"Display is not very smooth. touch is  slow, face unlock is also slow. Battery charged fast with 3x fast charger. But in comparison with Moto turbo charger its slow.  Battery backup is not as 5000 mah. its like 4200-4500 mah. Camera has no option to stop shutter sound. while camera is  very good with some nice features. Some internal feature is good.  Some times mobile hang, while i do not have any game in mobile.  Contact dialer needs more improvement. Overall a good mobile in this budget. Please take 4GB 64 Gb version.  6.5 star in 10 from side.",3
"Bought this couple of weeks back and been using as my primary phone. Below are some of the things that I have noticed:

+ve’s:
Bright, Vibrant display.
Only phone to offer wide angle camera at this price range at this point of time.
5000 mAh battery with USB type C support.
Fast Charging.
Better after sale support.
Dolby Atmos is a plus if you are carrying a good headphone/earphone.

-ve’s:
Struggles with stable performance.
Bitter Gaming experience.
Less powerful processor compared to Snapdragon 636.
No Notification LED.
Plastic Glossy finish is a dissapointment.

If you’re into heavy gaming then this is not for you but if you wish to have a sturdy reliable smartphone for daily usage with good battery life for a complete day and performance from big brand then Samsung Galaxy M20 is a good choice.",3
"At 3 GB Ram you expect a great performance. But the performance is soooooo poor as most of the time the ram is full of junk.
Very slow phone despite repeated attempts of re-setting.
Phone hangs every hour!
Phone rings but you can not see the display....
With slow response...you have no clue if the phone is working or just hung!
Samsung! what a disappointment.",1
" I got the phone and instantly noticed that it was heating for no reason, even when no apps were running. Also the screen suddenly is unresponsive. I contacted Amazon saying I got a defective product and then they told me to install some diagnostics app. They say that your phone, according to the tool, has passed all tests and it is working fine. I told them that I will send you video evidence of it suddenly not working. They said we don't accept video evidence. I certainly will not buy from amazon anymore. I have posted one of the videos of the phone clearly having issues.",1
"The phone is extremely slow while operating with few apps. The response time is high and also few serious problems with the phone, like volume (extremely low), speaker voice is low, even the ringtones are not upto the mark and low volume as well. Highly dissatisfied. Also so many errors were observed. Many times hanged like 2003-2005 era phones. Seems to be bending due to overheating and slow response. It takes 6 seconds to disconnect a  all, surprising.",1
Display of this phone is not good. I found hanging issue always while using multiple screen. Also touch is not good as compare to MI or HONOr. Also there is no notification light present. In order to open screen always need to click on power button which is not good. Total dissatisfaction from Samsung. Wanted to return but they denied to return the same.,2
"Samsung is the looser again vis a vis Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo...
- Poor network signal reception
- Poor interface...
- Xynos is sluggish...
- useless default Samsung apps eating storage space.
- Poor cameras, both rear and front, live focus never focuses on the face detected.
- notifications popping up, even after turning off the settings...
– even after the latest update in June19, phone hangs, screen freezes, some buttons work on their own...

Totally Disappointed.... Not recommended to buy... DON'T GO BY THE PAID PROMOTIONAL ARTICLES.

Even 1 star is NOT deserved, after having updated it in July, 2019. Still Hangs every now & then, signal and voice loss issue, no improvement in camera pic quality...

After another software update in Sept.,19, it is functioning erratically still... new issue Sim1(Jio) is getting turned off on its own. Other issues remains as it is......",1
"Very Bad experience.....now a days samsung company is cheating.... To be in the competition they are selling cheap materials in the name of Samsung..... I cant expect it from such a renowned brand.... Mujhe phle se hi pata tha ki aaj kal samsung market me kachre ke naam par itna paisa le raha hai.... But mere father k viswas ke wajah se aaj mujhe regret krna pad raha hai... I gifted my father samsung galaxy M20 on 02/02/2019 and (23/10/19)today i received a call from my home stating the phone is dead.... We send our brother to service center wgich is 45 km far from our home and there he got reply in a rude way that come after diwali abhi nhi ban skta aur bina check kiye bol rhe hai ki iska motherboard kharab hai.... Aap baad me aana to check krke batayenge..... Very very bakwaass company.... Right now I am feeling cheating and looted..better to go for Mi, Honor, realme, one plus.",1
"Phone is made of plastic and looks like other chines phones.
AI selfi camera is not good as it will make you pics flat, also figure print sensor is not easy to use as it should be in middle of phone body.
3gb model is slow while using multiple apps and I would suggest to for 4gb if you are looking to play games.
Phone is not hand as it is vey big and overweight.",3
"Rear camera is wide angled but low quality. Touch is bad, many times unresponsive.  Earpiece also creates some rattling noise while on call. Also some times keys remains continously pressed even after you remove the finger. Less features than Mi. Also it hangs sometimes. Screen is big and clear. FACE AND FINGERPRINT reader are not so quick. Earlier I was using Mi Note 3, it was much better.",3
"I am writing this after 5 days of use -

Pros
Battery Life
Look
Rear Camera in daylight
Fast Charging

Cons
Front camera is not at all good. In low light if you click pic it will like clicking a pic from Chinese phone .
Quality of Display and screen is not upto the mark.
Face recognition in low light do not work.
Mobile not for gamer specially PUBG.

Overall - Mobile is good camera works good in daylight, nothing extra in the name of wide angle view because image quality do not remain the same. Mobile good for working person as the backup is good and also fast charging.",3
"Samsung says the 'M' in M20 stands for millennial, as we know millennials take selfies but no millennial would like to take selfies from the godforsaken front camera. So I would say the 'M' rather stands for middle age.

Still it has better display and ui than godforsaken Chinese phones. Also samsung is samsung, they focus on quality experience rather than specs.

Don't go for it, the ui lags and camera is worst. Samsung again failed to charm in budget segment. Also all 5 star reviewers are either superdumb or fake.",3
"I am writing this review after using mobile 8 months only.
Mobile working fine till 7 months, in 8th month the problem started like charging.
Some times due to winter climate, the charging will not happen, and show error as moisture in the charging cable, so charging will not happen. So we have to remove back cover and keep open for some time and then after reconnecting the charging will happen. There is a issue of Charging. Don't know either problem in charging cable or charging port of mobile.
Removing the back cover is very difficult and hectic.

Plz think before you buy this mobile once again.",1
"1.In screen Finger print reader is a really bad idea if you can't really make it happen properly samsung. Big flop. It doesn't read ur finger easily and takes too much time.
2. Camera quality is fine. nothing much below expectations in this price tag.
3. Battery life is average 1 Day.

When you unlock the phone or say when you wake it up in mrng it will take a little while to show you welcome screen as first it will show the message that phone is starting up as if u have switched it on. very very slow in processing . don't  buy this crap. rather go for any basic phone in 10000 price segment it may satisfy you up to some extent but M20 will disappoint. I have not installed any third party application still it hangs while i receive any call and the screen wont show you pop up for call",1
"Worst, No use of 5000mah battery. I got this mobile to my mom. She use it very very light. But yet the charge is not lasting more than a day. I have used Mi, Azus, they are far better than this Samsung. other than the display and camera nothings is good in this phone. The phone internal performance is also very bad.

My end point is it is better to buy a Mi, Asus, Redme etc than this Samsung.
Samsung cheats in the name of its brand value but no customer satisfactions",1
Worst phone 5000 battery drain in 1day with simple use so called fast charger takes 2.5 hours full charge but built quality is only good no headphone Samsung in budget phone always worst,1
"I came to know that this is a non refundable product only after purchase. Though the display and battery are good, cameras are really bad even for this price.
The selfie camera is over exposed and there too much artificiality in photos. Back cameras are slightly better but not good. The performance is laggy at times.

I am finding quality of pictures worse than samsung J2pro which costs lesser.
Cameras in old motog5splus are way better.

Buy this phone only if you don't care about cameras.",1
"The phone randomly reboots. And has issues with call quality and speaker. But as this started just a day after the warranty given by Amazon, I am being asked to contact the service center. And now the hassle begins - niether can use the phone nor have to sit worry free about servicing. Would  have been better buying Redmi or Xiaomi instead of this Samsung!",1
"Samsung galaxy M20 keeps hanging.
Whatsapp features aren't working properly even after updating OS.
Selfie camera quality is good but rear camera gives shaky photos like ut is too sensitive of even blood circulation of our hands hurts the quality of the picture which we take from this camera. This needs to be resolved samsung mobile.  I think Blood beats shouldn't effect the shaky thing of the camera quality.
Battery life is amazing.
The hanging problem of samsung handsets remains the same in this handset too.",3
please dont purchase from amazone its new product of samsung and ther is no good perfom this phone camera did not good i will purchase it from deal but phone will automaticaly shut down and did not wake up from power buttun after that i will make soft reset and it will wake up i will complain it to amazone they are make some unsetified answer to me they did not exchange my phone i have 10 day replacment warranty but they are  not help me,1
"Kept in my pocket with my Office Id Card (No Metal , all plastic) , still this Samsung Cheap Model Screen managed to get a scratch on it , had use Honor , And other Chinese models , they have a better screen Quaility then this , also the colors are not as vibrant as LCD screen , Note this is a TFT screen .

And the mobile is 2 X heavy then any normal mobile phone
Back Panel is ugly .

Good thing is battery and cost",3
"I was using Redmi for the past few years and selected Samsung for a change.

1)  In terms of performance, Redmi is better than this Samsung phone. One of the issues I faced when we click nothing happens some times.  If I use the lock button and unlock again and it will work. But overall there is a delay in all these operations.

2) Addressbook contacts were displayed incorrectly.  Several contacts had shown a different name. when I edit the contact the name is correct, but when the call comes it shows another name ( this is not from Truecaller or any other app) same issue on WhatsApp messaging as well. The name is shown differently for a few contacts.  I had to delete the contact and recreate it to fix this issue.

Battery life is good and I appreciate it.",3
"It was all good at first then after 7 days, the touch on screen stops working  suddenly. Also the phone gets touched without touching,  idk why its happening, and you have to lock and unlock the phone to get it work again, now its starting to happen more often, and it sucks, never expected something like this from a brand like Samsung. I always loved Samsung  but it disappointed  me so much, I will never buy a Samsung  phone again. Now I can't even return the product as the retuned window was closed...",1
"This Phone is not proper at all , its fingerprint is slow ,and the amazing thing is that it is not a waterproof phone and felt so disappointed that its Power Button started not working after it felt in water that was also a little bit water on chair , after that it got automatically volume increased and decreased , i switched off the phone and kept it in a airtight rice bowl after a day it got cleared the vapour in cameras but finally the power button has stopped working, About Battery, it is fast charging i agree that but it is a fast charge losing phone also  , About camera it is Good and clear , the live focus sometime not blurs at some corner while taking a persons photo , gaming is good  but not excelent some times its walpaper get displaced after coming back home from game like pes 2019 etc (all of the above details are my own experience with M20 4 +64Gb, black varient)",1
"In this phone fast charge is not work proper. Only 10% - 12% charge in one hour in mobile, I experienced this daily... Very bed... Please don't buy... It... Please fast charging is didn't work.... Plz plz don't buy it.",2
"this model has problem with UI/Software and by the time u find it and decide to return/exchange window will be closed return window is short on purpose .touch screen stops responding or gets remarkably slow compared to 5 yrs old HTC mobile!!!
However detailed feedback is below.
Expected better product from Samsung when all the hype around M series, but disappointed with what we get!! Below are pros and cons with 15 days of usage.
Pros
1. Decent battery life depends on your usage.
2. Good screen size

Cons
1. Average camera quality when compared with other brands
2. Finger print sensor compared to other brands( Moto G series) is pretty slow response.
3. Heavier than normal phones due to battery.
4. Battery not removable, not sure how long it lasts.
5. Worst part Samsung can't afford to provide hands free, unacceptable.
6. Observed lag even with 4 GB memory, lot of unwanted apps comes pre-installed and eats up space.
Definitely would not recommend M 20, if you are looking to buy decent phone and spend around 12k !! Definitely better phones available at this price range.",1
"About this phone, I would say, good things are good camera, good build, storage , battery life . Issues I faced are less signals, fingerprinted reader does not work , phone heats up ( although Samsung not heat up, but seems M series do heatup.
If coming to overall review I would not recommend Samsung M series phone . Other phone in same series are quite good",2
"Hello guys,
I am writing this review after I think 5 to 6 months later purchasing this product.
And
I am not at all satisfied with the product.
In fact after doing all the exercise I am of this opinion that the Samsung is cutting cost by compromising quality for sure.

I am saying this because earlier I was using Mi redmi 4A which was working superb.
I thought that lets upgrade the phone and I bought this mobile which turn in pain for me.
The quality of network reception is so bad that many places it just doesn't catch network.

I went to customer service with this problem they have change the mothee board but problem stayed unchanged. After that i asked them what to do ?
They straight away lift their hands and ask me to talk to customer care. Which I did so but to no avail.

So friends my suggestion here is to not to go for such compromised quality phone when u have better options available in market.

Thank you for reading and be careful ...",1
"Before starting using my new galaxy M20, it got hanged and I couldn't use it until the battery drained off. It has 5000amp better, so it doesn't drain off quick and I had to wait for 3 days. Also there is no option of getting it replaced because it Hangs since when the technician visits and checks, unfortunately the phone works fine and doesn't hang.
Hang means you can't switch off, you can't switch on, no screen, no buttons working, all you can do is look at it and cry on your decision of buying galaxy M20..",1
"Pros:
1) Superb battery backup, it takes two hour to full charge, and with a moderate use i.e streaming YouTube playing games and using social media for half of the day, it lasts easily  two days.
2) Rest of the things are ok, I am taking it for granted which could b expected from 12000/-
Cons:
1) Camera is not up to mark, dual camera 13 megapixel  all seems to be bullshit if it can't  click a decent picture, all these dual and triple camera are just marketing  strategy, my Lenovo k5 vibe 3 year old phone even clicks better pic than this phone.
2) Just unnecessary  long screen  which is actually  of no use, bcoz non of the video at any platform is created of aspect ratio 19.5:9, they all are 18:9 ; so what happens  actually  is when you play a video in landscape two wide black strips will be visible to you on either side and if you zoom in to fit to screen so that you can experience  the immersive  feeling  which they were advertising top and bottom portion of image goes off.",3
"The tagline should be changed from ""I'm infinite"" to ""My screen freezes and have ghost touch"".

Very very disappointed due to this problem. I am OK about the considerably slow finger print reader and face recognition. I would have praised the rich specs available for the reasonable price. But I face Screen Freeze and Ghost Touch issues at least 40 times a day.

Online forums do not even acknowledge the problem and a software update with solution for this seems to be optimistic to the point of idiotic.",1
"No heptic feedback for the soft keys and keyboard. Sometimes screen got freezed and neither fingerprint works nor face recognition. App takes more than normal time to open. Even systeyapps like settings app takes time to open. Not upto mark.
Canera is a plus point at this price. Battery is really good. Lasts more than a day.  Display design is awesome.
We can expect these missing features to be fixed in the future updates.",2
"i didn't like camera at all, J2 has good camera than this mobile... MI Note 5, 6 and 7 (pro) is better in this range Samsung was famous for Almond display and camera both of these are not in this mobile, I bought this after taking review of #TechnicalGuruji but the review was fully biased in favour of Samsung. if you bought u will regret for Camera especially for selfi that blurred to much. i was expected that samsung will do something new, but nothing is new Mi has better technology than samsung.",2
"1)  Performance was not good, some time its take too much time in processing and installation.
2)  rear camera quality is ok,but front camera quality is very very poor.
3) i had go to service center after then 4 days of purchasing, due to fingerprint scanner issues
4) touch are not smooth.
And most disappointing point is the Amazon's technician are declined my returning request. They do some online  checkups and declined my returning request
5) only battery performance was good

* so,I'll suggest you  to not to buy",2
"This M series like all other Samsung series is a big scam. Yes they are providing so much features for less price but once you buy the phone, you will realise that every this is bad. Be it camera, finger print and dont even get me started on top notch display. My display went blank in 15 days of use and Amazon has only 10 days replacement policy. I went to Samsung care and they said they will charge money for changing it because display is not under warranty, wtf. It's not just with me,seeing this beautiful ad, my friend bought M40 and has to suffer same problem.  Though he was lucky his display went black on 4th day so he returned and bought some other phone. I also met 6-7 other customers at Samsung care with same issue. Dont buy I suggest.
~A sincere frustrated customer",1
"First of all, if you are here for the CAMERA, I am sorry to tell you I dont give 2 cents to a camera, So this is not the place for stuff like that.
With that part out of the way, LET'S JUST JUMP INTO IT.
-----------------------------------------------------------
I have uploaded some AIDA64 snaps, take a look at it for specs.
Okay, if you are reading this review after all of that gargon I just puked you are most probably pretty well versed in technical stuff, so I will more emphasis on hardware rather than software as the latter can be seen from the snaps.

HARDWARE -
¤This is an all-plastic phone, so the first thing you should do is to rush and buy a screen guard and cover for this bugger, because this backplate I gonna have a lot of scratches.
¤TFT screen, the standard for budget phones.
¤The buttons feel clicky and do their job unexpectedly good.
¤5000mAh Li-Po battery, won't argue on how much it lasts as it depends on usage, but expect atleast 2-3 days if you are moderate user (subjective)
¤PRAISE THE ALL-MIGHTY, There is an headphone jack!!
¤The notch is kinda there, but you wont notice it that much (#dealwithit)
¤The face sensor is kinda slow, even on fast sensing, your best bet is fingerprint sensor, which is pretty good tbh.
¤GSM/HSPA/LTE network tech.
¤See the chipset, CPU, GPU from snaps.
¤Can't comment about thermals, as I do most of the heavy duty stuff on PC.
¤MONO SPEAKERS, YOU ARE WARNED!!

SOFTWARE -
¤#RemoveBloatware seriously, this phone gets loaded with couple of bloatware from the start, remove/disable them as per need. I personally have removed nearly all bloatware and installed my own substitutes in their place, sorry Samsung Max :p
¤The blue light filter is pretty bad, get a competitive one ASAP
¤The phone is pretty snappy, so no qualms there and you will most likely have 500-1000MB free RAM available at a time.
¤The pop-up multiscreens are pretty dope, especially useful in COV (chat over video) scenarios.
¤The 'Dolby Atmos' is surprisingly good, give it a try for yourself, almost makes me forgot them for putting MONO SPEAKERS!

Well, I don't feel like I can add anything to this review, will update it when I find something new.

Overall, I find this to be a good attempt by Samsung into the budget phone array, some gaping holes (MONO SPEAKERS), some gracious glories (HEADPHONE JACK), whether they can keep this momentum going or get fizzled out by established budget brands like Mi is story of another time.",3
"I purchased this phone and delivered on 20 March 2019 , After using i saw Heat issue and its hang . what  phone with 4 gb ram is hang ., then i put for return multiple call done and finally got one help . they told me download an app then ask for pin then they checked from their side and said all ok please use .
Now after that checkup suddenly data is reducing very fast and for this they have no solution ........................... .
Please do not go for samsung now . they are not taking it back and amazon also not taking it back",1
"Touchscreen is not very effective and becomes annoying sometimes. Not expected from a present smartphone era where a normal effective touchscreen is the basic requirement of touch phone.
Camera pic quality is not as per the pixel given. Other smartphone cameras with less pixel value gives much better pics. Flash pics are totally ineffective. Pics without any movement of object n phone only comes ok ok only. Any slight movement of anything is blurred ???? Not expected with the specs of camera given",2
"the expectation for getting this phone was to get the latest OS features and speed as compared to my previous phone for which it failed totally.
Still my old phone(J7 2016 1.5 GB) is faster enough to compete this 4GB RAM.
pros-
battery camera and other hardware features are good.
cons-
Processor - it might not be good to try new processor which is not tested well .
the UI is not responding very well ... it looks Samsung did not tested mobile well before publishing.
try to find some contact and click on details ... the mobile will take 1-2 min just to display the contact details.
there are so many issues on UI side that need to taken care by Samsung ASAP.",2
"This phone sucks .. so much .. that.. it will suck more when you think that no phone can suck. I literally threw this away . It's bad .. don't waste your time and money.. every thing in the phone is bad.. camera, processor, ram, storage.  All sucks on every level. I broke this phone on purpose so that I should be motivated to buy a new one .",2
"Except battery life all other claims made by Samsung are wrong. It is a cheap product and Samsung with not be able to compete with MI due to 3rd class quality. I preferred Samsung over MI but now realizing it is a mistake. Bought same set in Mar 19 also and had to return due to software defective. Thought it may be a odd instance.  Again bought M20 in prime day sale but realising I should have gone for MI. M20 has cheap Samsung processor, so it hangs a lot. You receive call but screen remains black only, so do not know who us calling and how to take call. Do not buy this mobile, instead go for MI. Samsung will go down further with such bad quality products. They are not concentrating in quality. Only reducing price point will not give them a better position or market leadership. It will meet same fate as Nokia.",1
Ok mobile not for camera lovers,1
I bought a headache for myself buying this phone online from Amazon.No customer support whatsoever.the sim slots are defective resulting in limited network connectivity  and no data speed.No tech expert is available  and the smart check app doesnot get operative without data.phone was delivered  on 26 apr19.,1
"Packaging 1. Did not have thermocol protection inside the box. Must have a bumpy ride.
Performance
1. Flashlight did not start. Had to restart phone.
2. SD memory intermittently goes undetected on it's own and then comes back on it's own.
3.Keypad often get frozen and I have to wait till it comes back.
4. Camera picture is not good at all.
Body texture is good but with a sharp point at one point.

They allotted a service technician to inspect who claims that he is no longer with Amazon. What a joke!!",2
Mobile was very bad.heet during call.siglnals issue.pls if buy anyone this as a think that it is budget friendly so its ur mistake.i waste my money on this bad product,1
"I got this device for my mother but I don't think she can use it because of the excessive amount of bloatware pre-loaded onto this phone. There are so many useless 3rd party apps installed by Samsung which are borderline spam. You cannot even disable many of those. I cannot possibly recommend this phone to anyone unless samsung fixes this. There is no return policy on this device as well, just exchange. Avoid this phone at all costs.",1
"Very bad sound quality over the inbuilt speaker. Speaker output is noisy and not loud. They says Dolby Atmos, by listening music over speaker I can't understand why they fitted a dump speaker to the phone.
Meanwhile sound via headphone looks somewhat ok.
Battery backup is ok as of now, need to see after one week usage.
Face recognition doesn't work in low light and takes a little longer to get the screen wakeup and running.
Very bad response from Amazon on replacement due to sound quality issue.
They says to install an app to check, installed it and test passs., as you know the app won't verify the quality of sound.
Camera images are not high quality, noisy.
No notification light.
Guys do not buy, just run away from the product.",1
"I got it in the 1st sale. Having some extra expectations as I think it's an effort of samsung as comeback. Very average product with average battery performance. Do not get tempted for 5000 MHA battery, it's worst than 3000 mha. Other brands are out there in much better price and performance. Decent camera and screen.",3
"I would suggest Samsung... Don't compromise with quality and standard... This phone is the worst phone ever I used in my life.... Battery life is good, touch pad is really worst...  Material used by samsung is most cheapest compared to other phones in the market with the same range and lowest range....  Highly disappointed and finally sold at lowest cost bcoz no option of exchange with other phones on Amazon or other shopping websites....",1
"Worst service I have ever seen  by Samsung.  Even so called Chinese phone service is far better than so called branded  Samsung.

I have bought this phone on Feb 6 2019  and within 2 months the data cable is damaged and unable to charge my phone ,
 I went to service centre and said the problem they said it is physically damage and unable to replace .

What's type of built quality Samsung is providing.
Face recognition is very bad .
Battery life is pathetic can't even last for 2 3 hours . Fingerprint reader is damaged.",1
"Overall a mixed bag, with some good surprises and bad. Bought it in Sep 2019, writing review in Nov 2019, after heavy usage.
1. Security features -
Pro- are way too good. It allows you to selectively give permission to apps to your phone's contact, media, etc.
Con - BUT, overtly security features hinders screenshot taking ability citing "" security policy"". So if you like a Google image, you can't save it as screenshot. If you need a news article to be saved, or image on website to be saved, it won't allow a screenshot. It severely hinders usage and limits internetknky to surfing, not saving something for future use, never encountered it in other smartphones used till date.

2. Camera - Smartphones are primarily bought for internet, apps  calls and camera.
Pro - Above average pictures overall.
Con-
Lighter shades - Camera is unable to capture picture in natural light, as it is. Rather it adds whitish layer to all pictures. So if you are taking a selfie from front or back camera, either ways you will be captured at least 2-3 shades lighter or fairer. If that is what you want, it can be considered a pro as well coz pictures appear good BUT if you want to capture nature, sun, plants, animals or yourself as you are, then it's a disappointment as it is all in 2-3 shades of white/bright/light, however you want to put it.
Out of focus and camera doesn't capture despite wherever you tap - Another MAJOR con is camera fails to focus many a times, thereby capturing blurred images. You try rebooting, reopening camera but still it is completely blurred, and you can't figure out the thing captured. Due to this lack of focus, many a times it doesn't even capture image despite whenever you tap since it is so out of focus, camera fails to click and capture, rendering it useless. You need other people to capture the moment and depend on them to share pictures with you, sad!

3. Battery life - 5/5. Works for 2 days or longer, provided you keep switching data on and off and keep background app usage to minimum.

4. Sound quality - loud and good. Much better than other phones used.

5. Storage- 44GB is a life saver. You can download numerous apps and don't worry about space.

6. Built quality and sturdiness - below average. Other phones when accidentally dropped from bed/couch/road did not shatter, nor developed a crack. This phone's screen got majorly cracked when slipped out of pocket on road. Which seems to be fine since road is hard concrete, but it developed another screen crack chipping off on the edge when dropped from bed in short distance  on tiled floor at home. If it gets dropped no matter how small the distance or smooth the floor, it will crack, always, despite a cover and temper glass! Never found this a problem with any other phones used till date. They drop but body and screen were secure. Probably because the screen of this phone is slightly protuded from the body of the phone, hence whenever it drops, the screen faces direct and most impact, thereby cracking and chipping it off along with body at the edges. Possibly a design flaw.

7. Performance - is great. You can run any no. Of apps and it won't hang or slow down as yet. Hopefully it will remain so despite age and usage. Edited - Performance has turned average. The phone shuts down and reboots on its own when battery reaches 16% mark or when Youtube songs are being played, the phone shuts down automatically even when sufficient battery is remaining.

8. Touchscreen - Faulty. Sometimes nothing happens when the screen is touched. You need to unlock it and you slide k  screen and nothing happens. You have to lock and unlock for touchscreen to work again.

9. Backspace button - while making notes, if one wishes to delete a line or two and you quickly press backspace on keypad a couple of times, it automatically goes into a frenzy deleting ALL your notes in 2 secs. Tapping doesn't stop it, you need to go out of app and come back only to remember what you had written and write again.

10. Zoom - since the screen is a bit protruded, if you handle the screen with one hand using thumb to scroll the news site, then the thumb + the flesh below your thumb on your palm act together kn the screen and it zooms the screen instead of scrolling. You need to use both hands, one to scroll, one to hold the phone or rest phone on something and use ONLY your thumb to scroll. Design flaw probably.",3
"It's been quite a long time since I have been using Samsung M20 , I got it on may 31 so let's say 4 -5 months approx.
Good points-
*camera quality is really good , initially front camera was really good now it's not that good I say but back camera is still good. I will add some pictures I took from Backcam
*Look is okay.
*Samsung gives quality product so it will work for years.
*Battery is really good, comes with type c charger so fast charging is available
Bad points-
*initially finger print sensor worked really well now it does not even sometimes I have to type my password instead of using fingerprint.
*I personally feel display doesn't work that good.
*not good for gaming at all, initially pubg was playing OKAY but now it hangs and I don't feel like playing it at all , so if you are a gamer I would say a big NO.
*it was initially fine but now it hangs a lot bcz of pubg taking too much space of RAM or may be bcz it is one of the features that come with Samsung, if you are a gamer I think you should go for mi.
Overall I'm okay with this phone but what really irritates me is that it hangs a lot",2
"Let me tell you Normally I won't write review. But The price is equal to Today's phone in market like oppo, Mi, realme. Talking about camera I am dissatisfied. It's worst then oppo and mi. Believe me or not. I compared. Both camera it's won't give you a good quality photo. Now I understand why the price of the phone is so lowered by samsung. They degrade it's quality to make money.",3
"not a great buy. using it for past 9 months. Has lot of issues  - contacts disappear automatically, videos do not startup properly many times, camera is not so great. Only good stuff is the battery life. runs quite long. Even while typing sometimes its not fast and gets stuck at some character. Expected a better product from Samsung having used its earlier mobiles.",3
"Camera is average.

but after 20 minutes mobile starts heating,

Auto brightness doesn't work properly.

this is not the right choice, Don't buy it.

Sometimes, it's apps are open automatically.

Lot of junk samsung pre installed apps. No option to uninstall.

Camera quality is very poor. Painting effect is more in photos if we zoom.

Phone gets overheated if we watch youtube or in memory movies more than 30 to 40mins

Low light image quality is very poor.

Don't waste your money buying this phone.

Samsung has really let me down after all the hype and brilliant marketing of M20.

Don't buy Samsung galaxy M20.

I made a big mistake in trusting the brand ""Samsung"" blindly.

After 15 days of use touch is not working properly .

Poor built quality, highly disappointed

design was very ugly fully made out of cheap pollycarbonate easily scratch, mobile was very thick and heavy

The fingerprint sensor is too slow.",1
"Please don't buy this phone, very slow ordinary maintenance, very low quality product from Samsung, never works properly always buffering,  I felt very bad, some times it's more slow too, I tried same network's sims in a different mobiles but another one working too good, this may take long time to process each. It's worse performance phone don't buy",1
As the hype created by Samsung for this phone was huge I was tempted to buy the M20 (64gb variant). For my first app installation from play store the error called installation failed came up. It's been 20 days and I've not been able to install any app through play store and the samsung customer care have troubleshooted the phone numerous times and factory reset the phone as well. Now even if my phone is under warranty I'm being asked to pay for the service center charges. A very unethical tactic to harass customers,1
"Bought my first Samsung phone after using redmi note 6 pro. Long list of problems in phone. Don't ever buy.
Touch and UI is so lagging. Many times you can't receive calls. You have to switch phone screen on and off to get it working
Charger is not connected still it shows charging.
Network coverage is so bad
It Will show full network but while calling it says not registered on network. Have to put in flight mode to get it working.
Switched from 4000mah to 5000mah but still backup is only a day.
WiFi calling shows connected as vowifi even no WiFi is connected.
List goes on .....",1
After use of 1 week touch started working on its own and it is automatically doing some actions worst product dear amazon team kindly open return window for me I wanna return this product,1
"after 24 hours review, just inserted the sims, and started installing general apps, then mobile surprising me by Heating...Samsung M20|4GB,  Amazing cheat by Amazon.... you can feel heat whenever your using the mobile, then i Called amazon asked them to replace it not to refund money, don't have an option also,, he said, its a common issue, he told me to install baccon app, and he checked it , its normal issue,(its normal to them not for users) if your phone temperature exceeds 48 degrees, then they will replace, It's my 5th Samsung phone ,which is heating, i cant even talk for 10 mins, phone is heating, .....very disappointed by Samsung, you just lost a customer...all the best for the Heater...
Please don't buy this 5000MAH Battery phone series. think 1000 times before buying, its not budget phone , its a heating phone...i dont understand i want to replace it but amazon not allowing me to do...then what is the use of replace it with in 10 days...make it clear, if the phone is cracked then only will replace it....",1
"After long time I have purchased samsung phone because I know most of the samsung phones had hanging problem after few months of use and gets lagging, nevertheless I decided to purchase again because of I had hope something improvment is there. I write my review after using my m20 continuously 2 and half days
PROS
Fast charging support with type C port
only rear camera is good
display is good
OS version pie 9 is available

CONS
lower performance
heating issue
lags often
PUBG can't run with high graphics

 mai college me tha tab samsung ka phone tha
tabhi pachtaya aur ab 6 saal baad fir wahi galti ki purchase karke

HINT FOR NEW BUYERS
always think about snapdragon processors with good GPU

CONCLUSION
NEVER BUY SAMSUNG PHONES AS THEY USES EXYNOS LOW PERFORMANCE PROCESSORS AS COMPARE TO SNAPDRAGON PROCESSORS

ADVANCE HINT
Always compare 3 to 4 phones before buying
Thank you",2
"I don't want to rate, but its mine compulsion to rate atleast one.
Worst Phone... Automatically fluctuate display and typing unnecessary itself looks like that someone hacks your phone and they were using it, display hangs untill I press the power button,lock my phone and unlock it again.

I was initially suggested by my friends to buy oppo, vivo, or other But I preferred old brand, I was not expected this, beyond expectations.

Rest is Ok.",1
"⚠️⚠️BUYERS BEWARE. DO NOT BUY⚠️⚠️
I am editing my review.  Samsung has revoked support for two of its inbuilt apps i.e Myfiles & Device Care. Now this two inbuilt apps including few other Samsung & third party apps are no longer compatible with M20 . You can't uninstall or disable these apps as they are inbuilt. Now these two incompatible apps are causing glitches on my device. Also Some third party apps are not functioning the way they use to. I approached Samsung Customer care & also their service center but, both were completely useless & helpless.
They both agreed that Samsung has withdrew support for few apps which may cause some glitches on device but denied any help and that too when my device is still under warranty. I have mailed Samsung but haven't received any response yet.
So, i request any prospective buyers to avoid M series phone or even better Samsung phones.",1
"After using it for 1 month my mobile started giving problem like the power on/off button not working, I went to the service center of samsung, there they said its software problem, after half hour they said the mother board has liquid on it ( means it was merged in water) circuit is not working we have to change n the cost is 6200, how come a new mobile has liquid in it, I feel I am been cheated by big brand samsung, they said u can't claim because of water in it, n they also charged me for inspecting the mobile I have receipt of it, the problem was of on/off button but they diverted to liquid in it, can anyone please tell me what to do, it's just a waste of money having a dead mobile",1
"I am giving review after using of 5 days..touch is nice,fingerprint works well,wont get warm from back side,battery is giving for 1 day after continious use of net..main problem is network strength is too low suitable for peoples who stay near the tower,if i contact amazon customer care they told to install 1 app and online they did check and told mobile is ok..if i tell for replacement,that also they not did and simply they are telling 10 days replacement..really disappointed from samsung and amazon",1
"The display was broken in just two months and when i went to care for repair they told that ur phone has physical damage but there isnt any sign of damage on phone,,they told that ur phone is broken coz of pressure created in ur pocket of pant,,now if samsung display's phone is broken is juss by pressure of pocket then its not samsung its china aur bhai ese phone pe to thoo hai jo sirf pocket me tut jata hai worst phone..samsung pe thoo hai jo ese phone banate hai",1
"It's been 3 month am using m20, and suddenly its microphone is not working. I was MI user from a beginning ,first time I bought Samsung phone and that to in disguise. The camera Quality is not at par, battery drains very fast, charging speed very slow, overall I won't suggest anyone to buy this phone . But at a sudden within 3months microphone stopped working. If they deliver phone online they also start online servicing.",1
This phone is the worst!! It hangs and the screen freezes after some time of usage. Screen display is not up to the mark. It looks good but is not worth the money because of its slow and unreliable performance. Contacted Samsung Care but no help received. Cannot return the product as return window is closed. Actually  this phone creates a lot of junk files in a very small time which  is  the  main reason of its laggy performance.,1
"Waste of money is the word. Hopeless phone. I have been struggling with it for over a month now. The first function of a phone is to make calls and that only you can't do with this phone. Half the time it shows not registered on network and half the time you can't hear the other side. Whereas other brand phone working on same network in same area work fine. Battery is good but that serves no purpose if you can't make calls. It's an engineering disaster , I don't know how samsung clears such products. Pls don't waste your money on this and more so invite multiple problems. I have downloaded all latest software patches so those who would defend it by saying pls download latest software patch, pls maintain distance.Stay away from it and save your money and mental peace.",1
"After 7 months usage I will give real customer reviews I hope this review may be helpful  new buyers
Display quality
There is no doubt about display quality is nise
But out door quiet difficult to see display suddenly goes to black screen not able to operate few min after that's it will normally
Auto brightness not working properly
Processing software
Totally worst when we're in city network is full that time only its work good
Some time totally not working
Samsung exyno process net to improve
Camera
Out door  sunlight taken pictures is good
But indoor and night mode totally worst
Conclusion
Battery backup
Average only if you  use contusions or playing games battery discharge very fast
Normal user can buying this mobile
Overall feedback
This mobile can use only normal user
Not support network user and gamers",2
"The phone is good in this price range, battery life is decent it can survive a day with heavy usage,
camera is okay in this price range,
and I would say games like pubg work on this phone but the system interface becomes sluggish and heats as well while game is on, not preferred for high end gaming,
built quality could be better,
fingerprint sensor is average quality not very fast,
face unlock works great,
no earphones inside the box
screen ratio is great,
fast charging is great but sometimes fast charging doesn't work (rarely),
brightness level is low and cannot be adjusted properly,
Overall in this budget it is a good phone with a brand name and u can go for it if you dont prefer high end gaming experience.",3
"Very disappointed, after inserting sim phone gets automatically switch off and not getting on again. It's frustrating as i already spent 4-5 hours for configuring the phone and suddenly it's off. Very poor product.

Also Amazon is not ready for refund, they only providing replacement. Though its not mentioned on product page.",1
"I am using this phone for about a month. I made all the software updates and my app and memory use is low. Even then I find it as the Most rubbish handsets I have used so far. It hangs for more than 20 seconds with blank screen after the call ends. It takes more than 15 seconds to on the screen. Camera is good. But I am looking forward to return or change the set, if the problem persists Or if the problem is particularly with M20.",1
"Worst phone series ever by Samsung. Phone hangs alot. Touch doesn't work sometimes. I am facing issues at the same time when I am writing this. Camera is not as good J series also. Only good thing is BATTERY.
Face Id: opens with photo too
Fingerpring Id: works in multiple attempts
Camera: wide angle is adding two image from 2 cameras. Half images stays straight, half goes bended.
Battery : No doubt its 5000 mAh so works good but not best.
Charging: Fast charge is a myth for this phone.
Screen: you can hardly read anything in Sunlight.
Processor: I don't know why Samsung teied Exynos, snapdragon and kirin are much much faster than this.
Touch: Touch stops working and suddenly performs all action which you do when it stops working.
Most Important, PUBG: Dont even think to play Pubg with this. I stopped playing pubg on this phone at the end. Hangs a lot. Heats after 1 game.
Network: internet works good only when on Wifi. Tried in different places with different networks.

Only pros is Battery time. You can buy other phones in the same budget which are many times better than this.",2
"I'm writing this review after regretting the purchase. I really wonder how so many people has rated this phone in 4 stars, while it don't deserve more than 2 stars. First, there is no LED indicator, Processor is not able to compete with new age processors like Kirin which gives better performance and battery power. No earphones, No pre applied screen guard, or back cover. One UI is fairly good, except for the irritating part, that it continues to display everything in the notification bar, and there is not way to stop it. Also, the screen lags few seconds if more apps are loaded. Still testing the battery performance after 2 days of using. Will post results if satisfactory.

This is for Amazon Delivery and Return policy:
I had to wait till 6 P.M in my office to get this product, since I didn't had a backup phone(which was very irritating). Also, Amazon should allow the customer to return the product within the return window time frame, and allow to order some other product, even if customer is ready to pay the difference in charges, which is not possible right now.",2
"Updated Review - 0 Star for this phone, it is the worst phone I have ever used. I own 2 phones in my Family and both are hanging like hell. Now condition is that I have to wait for 15 minutes to open Whatsapp. Samsung Phones sucks... Never recommend Samsung brand phones to anyone, even low cheap chinese phones works well. Pathetic!!!!

Previous Review - It was a good buy, I purchased two phones for me and my uncle and these are working really fine. Battery back-up and phone performance is excellent.",1
"Most worst phone from Samsung and as well as Amazon most heated problem on each and every call
Battery not charged after over night plug in with original charger
Don't waste money for this m series of Samsung",1
"I'm not a phone/tech-phile and this is a layman's review.

I bought the mobile (4gb) approximately 2 weeks back. Speed is nice however the inbuilt apps and processor take up 2gb of the ram, leaving us with 2. The 64 GB of inbuilt memory space means I don't need a SD card yet.

Camera quality is fine, but tbh not my main concern.

The display is irritating when I'm trying to read a book, the bar with the home/return buttons doesn't disappear, thus reducing the viewable space.

The battery feels like a bit of a letdown,  due to the exynos processor it seems to draw down alkost as fast as any other mobile. (My last one was 2014 MI4 2gb ram and 16 GB memory).

The biggest letdown is the sound and brightness.

The sound is just not loud enough even at full volume,  headphones are definitely required to watch a movie/video.

The brightness tends to go up and down randomly,  this could be a bug or something. Not sure if I should complain/return or just carry on.

My MI 4 (previous phone) was tbh much less of a hassle to work with.",3
"Samsung m20 often getting hang ,not able to open single app in phone,if any app opened not able to attend
receiving call at that time,totally waste every time i used to restart after hang

Samsung service center also confirmed my phone as faulty they are telling we are not supporting online purchased
then why this mobile you are selling in online

still the problem not resolved pls take action on this need replacement do need full",1
"Fingerprint is slow and smudgy
Battery life is 5000 mah but it works like 3700-4000 mah
Face recognition is insecure even with eyes closed the device can br unlocked
Tge processor seemed to perform ok not for ganers but surely for one who likes samsung branding in this price
Camera quality is average
Device shows lags too sometimes so eam mangement could be better",3
"Vibration on the stock app
Auto-brightness problem
Fingerprint sensor
Battery life improvement
EIS should be add
Performance and Stability
These expectations should be fixed by the Samsung through OTA(Over-the-Air) updates in the upcoming days.

In this price segment, the only disappointment here is, Samsung doesn’t provide with the Gorilla glass and slow motion but the whereas, the camera quality is decent, so, it is up to you to take the decision.",3
"Samsung Global is one of worst service provided. The customer care executive sucks and gives fake promise.

Here goes my story:- i bought samsung M20 1st June 2019 and the phone screen went blank on 31st June 2019 and i walked to the authorised service center Marthahalli Bangalore, India on 7th July asking to get the same fixed and he promised to open up the phone and check if there were any water damage so that warranty would be void. After cross checking the phone he said, he has not noticed any such case and said itz an manufacturing defect. Then he said there are few minor scratches on the screen so will have to get the approval from head quarters and promised he would replace it for sure on monday once the approval is in.

So now the service center executive says this cannot be covered in warranty and i will have to bare the cost of new display. This is how they are lotting our money and giving worst service.

The Samsung, The worlds most untrusted brand.",1
"This is genuine review after using a phone for a week
1.Samsung gave the battery of 5000mah but its not up to the mark when compared with the other phones like MI in same range.
Battery will last up to 20-22 hrs with very average use.
2.The most irritating part about phone is frequent ads that appearing on lock screen. I tried many ways to remove it but it didnt worked
3.Mobile heat up terribly while using data as well when phone put on charge.
4. They provided with type C fast charger believe me it will take nothing less than 100 minute to fully charged
5.when you are doing whatsapp call sometimes your screen will not be visible(i experienced more than half of time while performing whatsap video call)
6.when you like take shots in low light then definitely this device is not for you. Camera perform disasterous in low light
7.Design is pretty good. Screen too have vibrant colors. But in other aspects samsung really  need to work hard",2
"I bought this phone on first flash sale..
Till date I've used 12 different phones from redmi note 3g to iPhone 8..
Pros..
Excellent screen
Excellent call quality both on earpiece and loudspeaker
Decent battery backup, USB-C *

Cons..
Horrible software integration and ram management
Camera sucks on multiple dimensions.. I can't even stress enough.. Trust me, this camera is sub par.
Audio quality over speaker, headphone and Bluetooth too.. Sucks... Major drawback.. I'm a Media centric guy and have an insatiable hunger for acute audio perfection.. This is not a phone for an audiophile..

Overall redmi note 7 pro is way way ahead and honor p30 lite too seems better compared to this shit from Samsung. Do not buy this phone... Buy some alternative..",3
"The most worst decision I have ever made in life is buy this phone ...... after using 3 months I am writting this .......this phone is not for selfie lovers.... phone is not smooth in using it lags .... battery life is just awesome I charge it once full at 8am and till 8pm it's used only 50 or even less then tht after a full day of Netflix Amazon prime , and etc but I'm a selfie lovers I personally look a camera oriented phone which has front and back camera to take perfect pictures but sad part is this phone doesn't has tht the pics u take are not sharp and get blurred  if u zoom I'm so much surprise tht my Lenovo k8+ does much amazing job than m20......this is not expected from a brand like Samsung after all this they say we can take great selfie really much a shame Samsung from start I never got attracted towards this brand but this phone I felt will be good but no it was like big no hence forth won't consider Samsung as my favorite brands for phone.......",1
"I bought this phone as a gift for my mom, on 10th of may ot was delivered. It is October and the phone is dead totally, in just five months its unacceptable. All I wanted to do was give my mom a phone but I have  ended up giving them headache, I live far from them so can't even help them with this issue. I bought Samsung as I thought is is trustworthy brand, but guess what "" it turns out not to be"". I am very very disappointed.",1
"Design 5/5
Dispay 3/5
Camera - Front 5/5, Rear 3/5

Battery 4/5
Batters takes 2 hrs 30 minutes to get fully charged.  They claim it's fast charger but it shouldn't take that much time.

Features 2/5
No great features compared to latest smartphones.
It's not user friendly. Very complicated functions.

Speed and Performance 3/5
My phone is 4 / 64 variant, still it has no speed as expected. Fingerprint lock is QUITE SLOW. Most  of the times phone hangs.

Sound Quality 2/5
Voice calling Quality is bad. Sound is quite low. This is same issue with all Samsung phones.

Value for money 3/5
In 12k it's good phone but you have better options in this budget currently.

The only reason I buyed this phone is brand name. But Samsung hasn't improved their midrange phones yet.

Still they have scope and loyal customers like me. Let's see if Samsung wins in comings next 6 months",3
"Hy Samsung care & friends , i bought this mobile just 14 day before and i have a lot of problem with it.
 Dear all who want to buy this mobile then i will suggest you not to buy this worst SamsungM20 mobile, because  the main things is the camera and its battery life  which which is very very poor,Week signal strength, no advance features, it is just to show off with its notch screen and nothing else.  Please dont buy this worst mobile 😡😡 I'm very angry with this mobile",1
"Fingerprint is fast but due to its placement you will feel it misplaced until you get used to it camera rear camera is good better that realme not better that xaiomi phones but front camera will disappoint you. Processor is super battery life super pubg in balanced mode works good, ram management is highlit of this phone in this price range better than all compitators for ram manganent. If you don't want camera and want the rest to perform super go for this phone.",3
"I have no option for zero star or else i would have rate this ""0"".
Awful phone, from the day one the touch is not working properly, we thought to try use some more days but issue persisted. when I tried to return exchange the product in the same week, the return time window expired within a week. now even i cannot replace the phone. Amazon customer care guy suggesting me to go to service center.

I recommend please do not go for SAMSUNG phones. and before buy any products check the return time precisely, nowadays Amazon and Flipkart will have so much of restrains on return policy which will be implicit and arduous for normal people to understand.",1
"I really I'm  starting to hate this phone.
Problems I'm  facing:
 Bugs:I don't  know if this is software  issue or something, but I don't  like this.
Phone hang: after using for hours you'll see this phone getting hang.
Charging: At first , you'll  see fast charging but after some weeks, there's  no such thing as fast charging. Infact I left the phone charging from 1:30 PM(27%) before exam but after I came from exam it was charged to only 61% at 3:20 pm (approximately but not less than 3:20 pm).  So it took around 2 hours to charge to 34% and it's  really disappointing  for gamers like us.(Btw I'm  writing this review just because of disappointment: the tempered glass and the back cover as well) . People don't  really sell the product like they show from the Amazon pic.",3
"This is to inform you, your technician about to visit as per scheduled time on 03/08/2019 at 6:00 PM he called me before 2 hours that he's coming after 2 hours he said he will not come asked me to send the screenshot of my mobile as he wants to the online troubleshooting for it which is not possible even though I informed my issue, first of all you have sent the defect piece to me and not provided the complete resolution because of this I cancelled my other appointments, waiting for the technician Without seeing it, he confirmed like it's a good product u must keep it. I want to publish the same on social media which is happening on amazon.in so that people get awareness for ordering the product. Worst ever service. I need the replacement as a compensation towards your worst services.",1
I'm not happy with this mobile as I expected.,3
Google I'd Sign-in problem....,1
Well in short I will say it's ok ok device not up to the mark at least Samsung is trying but you have to improve with more will suggest you better go with the redmi note 7 Pro the processor is not as good I think its slower than the Snapdragon 625 sometime the device is freeze do not suggest you to buy this one if you want the device only for normal use then it's good battery life is awesome performance is not as good as compared with the other brands in this price segment,3
"Background:
I bought the Samsung M20 on Feb 22nd in one of the flash sales and was practically waiting to get my hands on it seeing the spec at this price. I was using a Blackberry Passport and iPhone 6 while ordering this phone, and was hoping to move to a single phone with a good spec with this purchase.

Item Review before the problem:
The item was received on time, thanks to Prime. I was also pretty satisfied with the usage of the phone in these past days (except for the problem that I was unable to upload any old photos to Instagram and such other apps - some weird bug because of which some of the previously available photos on the HDD wouldn't display at all. The same would be displayed individually, if we click on it). There wasn't any lag and photo quality was decent as well. Sound was also good (in contrast to some reviews I had seen online). But then I was hit yesterday with the biggest problem that nobody should face in a new mobile phone.

The Defect (Starting Stage):
The screen suddenly started showing a black mark below the back button. This seemed weird to me because I hadn't seen this ever till then. At first I thought this was part of the wallpaper, but then slowly the phone started scrolling slowly and the responsiveness reduced in the next 1 hour. In another 15 minutes or so when I got a call, I noticed 2 new silver linings towards the right bottom part of the screen. Now I was alarmed. This mark onset a new problem, the unexpected pressing of the back button.

I went to the Settings screen and removed the buttons and made it full screen, hoping this might be a temporary glitch. Restarted the phone. But to no avail, the marks were still existent there. Next the worst thing happened. There started appearing black straight line on the complete right side of the screen. Eventually, the screen started greying out while being used and I was unable to type anything. By this time I was fuming and getting irritated by the phone reacting this way for no fault of mine.

The Defect (after 2-3 hours of Problem Starting time):
I had to lock the screen each time the screen became unresponsive and unlock again with fingerprint to continue what I was typing. All this just for around 15-20 seconds of typing, after which again the same would unresponsiveness & greying out would set in. Mind you the back button also kept getting pressed every now and then involuntarily. By this time, the black straight lines on the right side of the screen had become permanent. Within the next hour, the whole screen was covered with moving lines like that of an alien transponder and I was completely unable to type by now.

The Defect outcome (Present condition)
As I took out my SIM and placed it back into my old iPhone 6, the screen died completely. I could hear the lock and unlock happen with fingerprint but there was 0 response on the screen. Has anyone else who has bought the M Series problem seen this problem?

Resolution:
Now I want the seller or Amazon to answer what this is all about. I'm unable to use a phone I bought less than 2 months ago for no fault of mine on one fine day. Requesting somebody to help me out from this mess.",1
"Worst product I have ever seen... Samsung lost his credibility due to launching M series... I bought this device on Independence Day sale... since the date of purchase,  I have been facing lot of problems...especially poor touch screen, display and some software issues.. since the phone has been replaced by Amazon.. But I am facing the same issue with the new device too... I did factory reset 10 times and software update twice. Techincal persons from Amazon visited to my home and scrutinized my phone thrice. Despite the consequential efforts, the issues have not been resolved. As per Amazon's policy, they don't provide second time replacement..
So my money has wasted... now I  am wasting my time by visiting Samsung service center regularly...
Henceforth I ll think twice to purchase a product in Amazon... A bad experience to me ...
So dear friends  don't purchase Samsung M series mobiles",1
"So i bought this phone on 1st of March 2019 and the problems I've faced just in a span of a 45 days are
1. The phone's display went off
2. Before the display went off there were already lines on display a week before
3. This phone hangs very often
4. There is always a bad sound in the speaker of phone while talking to someone
5. Charging is super slow.

So i didn't expected all this from a brand like Samsung. Cz to compete in market you bring out low budget phones to fool the customers but try and understand that the other companies are offering way better phones compared to Samsung. But customers like us buy this as we think at least the service is good and brand has a decent status in the market. But no i was under a wrong impression. Samsung is the worst brand and i would never buy any Samsung product specially Samsung phones.
Definitely NOT RECOMMENDED.",1
"I bought this phone last month (May 2019). I used this phone (with Sim Card) in India for 4 days and then moved to China. Unfortunately, Chinese Sim cards are not working at all. Before leaving India I spoke to Samsung Customer Service (CS) and asked whether I can use this phone in China or not? They told, yes sure...the Sim card provider will give you a code...use that and then your phone will work. But when I discussed the same with different telephone operator (China Mobile, China Unicom, and etc) they told your phone is not unlocked for China..we are helpless just speak to Samsung CS. Then I tried to contact Samsung CC over the web and then they told you to need to Visit nearest Samsung store/service centre and check your mobile, we can't do anything remotely! By paying money why should I suffer a lot?

Even now I am not able to return this Phone also as I am in China. Dear Samsung, I am afraid to trust you in the future!

JUST THINK...I SPENT INR 13000 AND NOT ABLE TO USE THIS PHONE WITH SIM CARD! ...ONLY OPTION IS WITH WIFI...so my rating are based on that!

EDIT: Later I contacted the Samsung Customer Service Centre in China, and they replied that Samsung is not selling Galaxy M20 in China, so we can't help you in this regard!

If you have any solution, please help me!

Thank you.",2

"Don't buy this product. Samsung brand strategy introduce us to don't buy low budget phone. You need to purchase a good budget phone otherwise you will get very disappointed.

M20 was looks good, 4 GB RAM and 64 GB internal storage attracted me to buy the phone. That day I was stand with my friend suddenly the phone simply down on surface and the mobile glass was broken very easily. I changed the glass and touchpad by paying 4500.

Phone price 11990 + 4500 (Glass replace) total I paid for this phone = 16499

That's mean the experience showing us like please buy Samsung mobile with minimum 16499 price otherwise your phone's glass or other thing should be damage.

I always preferred to buy a economy class phone. This is not a single case. Last time I was also buy same Samsung on 7 mobile. That time I was face issue with the internal storage.  That time I was also not able install a single application in the mobile due to low storage. That time I was disappointed. This time also disappointed.

My experience is very bad with the Samsung Mobile brand (with economy class mobile).

It's mean if you want to buy a Samsung mobile you need to make your budget above from economy class.",1
"The product is a average rated one. Let's talk about good things.
1. The face reader is good and so as the fingerprint sensor.
2. The size of the phone is good to handle.
3. The camera quality is pretty much ok compared to the other phones in this range.

Some not so good things of the phone.
1. Though the phone has a huge battery of 5000 mah but it drains pretty much faster. You can hardly use it for a day and half if you have the net on. Samsung needs to work on the battery aspect. Though you have an option to power saving mode, I don't think it makes a huge difference. The battery back up is far better in MI phones.
2. You are very much likely to face network issues with this phone. Another not so good review bout it.

Other than the issues the fone is decent enough to use. One must not have too many expectations from it.",3
"Despite being heavy in RAM and good processor speed, the phone has heavy lagging issue. I was unable to install even whatsapp for first 1 hour and when finally it was installed, it kept on crashing every 10 minutes. Forget about restoring the backup on the apps, even newly installed app had trouble running. Don't know it was the problem with my phone in particular or with m20 series in general but despite trying to make it work for 24 hours, I had to finally return it. Thanks to amazon that it was returned promptly, though I am yet waiting for return of my money since last 2 days. I was using moto g 4 earlier and despite having only 2gb RAM, moto was much faster than m20 which has 4 gb RAM. Is it because of heavy and RAM intensive customizations done by samsung, that only samsung will be able to tell. If samsung really want to compete with xiomi, they should better work less on the android customization and any customization should be optional rather than putting load on phone in the form of bloat ware. If it is not because of customization, then they should verify the supplier of their hardware whether declared specifications are actually usable. Anyhow, not at all satisfied with Samsung m20.",3
Bought it with a defective speaker sound...But no replacement for the product...simply advised to near a samsung store to repair...,1
"Very worse product from Samsung, without cover and protection kit. Display look is not ideal, it is toward outside which give very bad look, prefer realms 2 pro instead m20 of this segment.total waste of money. And also don't believe Gaurav Chaudhary youtuber feedback bcz he takes he is not as earlier.",1
"Hey everyone  ,  who so ever are making the plan of buying please dont buy because they are giving very poor quality mobile phone and the camera quality is really bad and phone is hanging too much so I would prefer that no one should buy this and you can view the the Vivo and Oppo because these both company are giving very good quality service and good quality mobile phone to the customers and they are very low in Rangers so if you are planning to buy a mobile phone in the low range then the best option is vivo and oppo and I will prefer you to buy the Vivo and Oppo accept Samsung and I already visited Samsung service centre two times but they didn't give me that much kind of service by which I felt satisfied except battery there is nothing good in this mobile phone and I have one Vivo v9 which is very good in every situation and in every condition and I am using Vivo from last 1.5 years and I never felt bad and any kind of problem in that and if any customer gonna buy this is contact me I will tell you everything about that mobile phone clearly that what is proper mobile they are giving to their customers . Any query contact number is 903 4466 339",3
"Im a regular user of Mi phones as it's cheaper and gives almost many features which one can get from other brands like samsung. I gifted this Samsung M20 to my wife on birthday but this was her worst gift ever as she was frequent user of Samsung and when i was buying from Amazon she was reluctant and warned me to not buy online atleast her gift as she don't trust quality but i did order and superised her and result is bad decision of buying Mobile online as other feedback says too that issues like :
1. Phone gets hang within few mins of use.
2.auto reboot happened initially within a month for couple of times.
3.spacebar on keyboard doesn't work well and frequent issues in keypad.
4. Scroll and touch issues. What all should i mention usually i dont write feedbacks inspite  I'm frequent buyer from Amazon but not i think i need to reconsider my buying option from Amazon as quality for Consumer electronics are not maintained at their inventories or fulfillment centres..I'm helpless amd speachless but such delivery and product features by Samsung. whose mistake I don't know but i feel like cheated and trust issues now.",1
"This mobile is the worst experience for me.
The proximity sensor of the mobile I have received was not working, also the photo taken from this mobile is  not too clear and sharp.The big issue in this mobile is ""hanging of mobile"". It is very slow , now I am frustrated with its speed. Before this mobile I didn't knew about what is hanging of mobile.
Only the good thing in this mobile is the voice clarity during conversation.
Also after procuring this mobile I am facing data issues,4G is very slowly and if we connect this mobile to smart TV with Hotspot, the picture clarity is poor, due to slow internet.",1
"Thought it will be good mobile for mom, but its more inferior than samsung galaxy J7 which my mom used previously. Battery life is worst,for 1st 12 days it worked properly since its given with 5000mah battery with 28hrs+ for videos, it used to work for 1 and half day, but now  almost after 20 days of purchasing,  watching youtube videos for 1 hr, battery goes down from 100% to 30%. And i hv bad experience with service center, if given mobile for this battery reason,  then they will just reset ur mobile and give it back, so i guess no use of going to service center also, so my money is wasted on this cheap samsung M20. Never again in my life i will by samsung mobiles.",1
"This is my seventh phone from samsung.. i took this phone this time too because of Samsung brand even when other good options are available like redmi, mi, asus .  and this time Samsung has broken my trust.. you may have seen many positive comments.. either they don't have problems in the units they got or they are not able to find out. But in my unit it sometimes touch don't work.  You can't get to know by normal usage.  But if you're typing message then it will skip touch and you'll miss words.. or if you're scrolling webpages.  It will skip touch.and it is too annoying.. the touch senstivity of this device is very poor...
Another biggest issue is network coverage.  It catches such a less network even when other phones with the same sim card catching good network.  And the speaker and sound quality of this phone is very very inferior..  camera is also not good , actually about camera i was knowing before buying it..
Guys don't go for Samsung brand .they are taking wrong benefits of your trust .and this is gonna be my last Samsung phone.  Now no Samsung phone ahead ! Thank you.  Insta@theamitdevyan",1
"This product is a big ""NO""
First of all I m writing this review from my old Moto g5 plus which saved me at the 11th hour and not like Samsung m20 which failed at the trip and stopped working , this Samsung phone hangs for no reason and the build quality is also not that great for a 13k phone the camera quality is very dull and the focus mode is very unreal , the vedio quality is also pathetic and this one stopped after the 5th month , very disappointed with this phone and remember this phone is not even splash proof so beware before buying this one . There are many good phones in the same price range and to add to this the face recognition is not of any use because anyone can open this phone even with your photograph .
Atlast I would say don't buy this phone if I remember looking about durability . The feel is even not that great",1
" My phone screen is not working properly. I have to off the screen and again on it after  that screen recognises my finger touch...it hangs the screen again and again.

Sometimes  screen works automatically without human intervention.

"Its a direct NO if you're purchasing for gaming. Don't even get that thought. The processor is very slow and takes ages to load. Graphics doesn't work properly in high graphics mode. No smoothness at all.
I tried it with many games like pubg, wwc2, asphalt 9, FIFA. Winner will become lost while playing games in this mobile.
Camera is amazing, split screen feature is crazy.
Perfect for ""NON GAMERS"".",3

Worst product and worst aap the phone i got my phone is had touch pad issue power button issue battery issue i wanted yo return the product bt as per them only replacement was available they had gave me replaced phone and this phone is also showing the same issue as i have 1 year warranty still i can see no option on amazon app to claim my warranty worst experirnce on amazon and worst product i ever recieve i want to claim my warranty please some1 help,1
The lasting of the battery is really good. I bought both 3/32 & 4/64 version of phone. 3/32gb verion works in a proper way  but after four days of uses  4/64gb phone gets off suddenly and it doesnt respond to any key despite i got heated near the camera portion. To check it i tried to charge it but it doesnt respond. After 7hour  i tried to charge it at that moment i respond with charging mode. While talking with customer care i got really disappointed because they are not ready to exchange  it another phone. The battery life is really good. All though i dont like the camera but getting it with 1300rs discount from its original price its enough from samsung.,3
"Attention Please! This phone was purchased by me on 12th feb. and was supposed to be my Fathers birthday gift. the phone was defective and amazon COULD'NT provide solution for this issue. And what i dont understand is what if the product shows defect after 10th day???? Is amazon still not responsible?? i am a regular visitor of Amazon and i didnt expected this from Amazon. Because of all this even after my dad's birthday he is using his same old phone.

the phone starts lagging again and again. touch screen not working properly. Lags almost twice or thrice in a couple of hours. same problem even in safe mode. Samsung not taking responsibility because it was purchased from here. not ready to provide written mail on that too. Visiting service center doesn't guarantee any data loss. Backed up on SD card but demanding phone to be kept for indefinite period to diagnose (At the expense of his office hours). what should be done???? If anyone has amazon complaint portal or email ID pls share with me.

Thank you.",2
"After using this phone for 15 days, I think I can provide a better review for this phone, Lets start with the battery, for first week the battery was fine, but since then I noticed that it is draining much faster, despite not using many apps even in the background, the sensors are flawed, screen keeps turning on and off while on call, sometimes pocket activity is noticed, the brightness of the phone is totally a mess, turning high and low like it has a mind of its own, now lets talk about speed, the phone hangs, lags, and gets stuck, just after 10 days of purchase, camera is OK, nothing great as marketing, I just bought it because of the name SAMSUNG, but it certainly does not live up to that expectation, a cheap phone with cheap hardware with no durability, i hope it completes 6-7 months before becoming a headache for me, My real review is that, i wish i could return it.",3
"Display is amazing. Exactly what expect from samsung.
Battery life is good. Not the best if you compare it with other phones having dual LTE and 5000mah battery. Azuz is a better option be as its snappy and doest have any lag.
Network quality is also poor.
Basically its aesthetically perfect however lacks practically.
This phone is laggy. Get stuck while switching screens. Heavy applications are a nighmare on this phone.",2
Received a dead phone. The phone got switched off after 5 minutes of usage and never powered up again.,1
"First of all i want to say that i got a defective phone.
Touchsreen sometimes not responding and sometimes behave abnormally.
Product review..
1.. screen is good being tft bright display and good pixel clearity.
2..having some good features like dual sreen pop up screen
3.. being 5000 mah battery  performance is ok  equvalent to 4000 mah battery of mi or realme
4 finger print sensor working ok but not fast someties take 1 to 1.5 seconds to unlock .
5 face unlock is not fast and sometimes  doesnt detect the face  so face unlock is disappointing  factor to me in this phone
6.. speaker is good enough louder than previous samsung phone
7 fast charging is good
8 adaptive light  sensing  is not fast like other phones of samsung or other brand
9.. front camera is bad in low light .in outdoor its just ok .back camera is ok
10 processor is  not fast.this phone is for normal  users for normal  use not for high performance gaming. Medium performance  games can be played easily but not  high graphics games.
If u have any questions  related  phone performance or anything i forgot to mention here you can mail to me at..

I am writing this review after 2 months of usage of samsung M20. I always buy midrange phones 10 to 14k but this worst . Trust me guys. And if you are mi user u would be dissatisfied big time. Few bad things i want tell - fingerprint does not work even if youch 4-5 times and it does not have vibration on fingerprint . No vibration on keyboard. Dual camera but no good blur effect. And worst part is that if you stand 2meater from camera facing camera then only it can create blur . If want to click object or if more than 1 person . It does not detect properly. Looks fake blurr. Front camera is also worst.  I would say worst cameraa of the segment. Dont buy samsung mid range phone. Its bad even after softwareupdate. Few more things . Watch any youtube review about m20 for more bad things. I line suggestion dont buy M series. This might be another reason its not availble on shops.,1
The best thing is its full display. Fingerprint unlocking is not that fast. Camera quality is good if you are on professional mode. In oreo touchscreen is a little bit awkward but after update to pie its perfect.Play 4k without any freezing. Sound quality is good but not that loud. Overall battery quality.,3
"Pros:
-Battery life
-Brand name ( this product is another unsuccessful launch of samsung to revive their Brand name )
Cons:
- Not living upto the name of Samsung
- Phone is frequently hanging even after a lot of free space (10 GB free space and still hanging).
-Frequent malfunctioning of touch panel. Have to lock and unlock it frequently for proper functioning
- Camera quality is very bad, when it comes to a comparison with Oppo and Vivo phone with lower grade cameras
- Finger sensor doesn't work properly
- Mic is also malfunctioning. Person on the other end is not able to here the voice.
- This phone is wastage of your hard earned money, probably this is one of the reason that why Samsung is losing their smart phone market to Oppo and Vivo

Now my battery is about to die. I have checked online for solution and found 1000s of complaints like this. Now I hate Samsung and i hate the person who recommended it to me. Don't buy it and certainly don't recommend anyone to buy it.

Still want to buy it..
Pros: good screen, touch sensitivity and good battery backup. Fast charging but useless when u can't even charge your mobile.
I am not a gamer but i do use number of heavy apps. All work fine and no lag.
4k recording.
Cons:
Unable to charge, phone is about to dead.
Average cameras. Low light is at it's worst.
Sound is not too loud, but ok.",1
"This phone is good but not better then other 3 gb ram phones .
Camera quality not good, battery backup  is 5 to 6 hour , problem in network connection,  and applications of tik tok is show tik tok not opened",1
"Samsung m20 is a very basic mobile. This is real review after using one month. Please consider me im sure, i have frustrated and writing this review genuinely.
Pris:
1. Display, its good compare to other low budget mobiles. Satisfied.
2. Battery, i don't know about other mobiles but it's good. Satisfied.

Cons:
1. Software, frequently hangs, regularly stops working. Greatly disappointed.
2. Performance, performance is not up to the mark.
3. Camera, so disappointed with camera quality. Not reach ung minimal.
3. Gaming, if ur a gamer just don't even though to buy it. My experience, pubg stucks all the time, even games like 350mb also stucks some times. Only to play candy crush. It's better.
4. Sencors, while calling the display won't go off automatically, it's annoying. Always we should press side button to make screen dim. While calls screen goes piping something. Very worst case of mobile.
5. Apps, apps always gets stucked. Disgusting.
6. Network, i observed network issues all the time. May be some problem.
7. Dolby sound is not so impressive.
8. Display acting wiard some time. It goes automatically switch to some thing.
9. There are so many features are missing internally, i observed many in MI phone like security, theme, sounds, display, wifi password scan, touch, camera, hidden features and many.

I may miss some information. Finally not recommended , if ur samsung lover may feel bad. My rating is 2 out of 5.",3
"This phone sucks. I bought this almost 2 months back. I have faced so many problems with phone.
1. It has the manufacturing issue earphone jack. This phone doesn't come earphone. After few when i bought earphone then i realized earphone jack is not working at all.
2. I get it fixed from service center. But again there was issue with jack so i again went to service center they this can't be replaced now, come after problem become worst. So i am still tolerating the sou d disturbance
3. Now this speaker is not working  properly but it has sound disturbance sometimes that's why they will not change it.
4. Touch sensor doesn't work that smooth.

These are some serious issue which i am facing with this phone.... this is the worst phone of Samsung",3
Please don't buy specially any electronic item from Amazon as it provides fake products. I had ordered m20 the day it got delivered it started hanging same day and also the phone was getting heated up in 10min of use. When I had complained and asked for replacement they said they can't do as the product is okay per their online verification. I said what will idoif my product again start heating up after replacement period of 10days is over then executive said we cannot replace the product neither we cannot refund. I said and if the phone gets burst out by heating then who will be responsible then he said mam we cannot do anything do whatever you want to do and he has disconnected the call,1
"Phone is good. But the main thing of the phone that is proximity sensor doesn't work well. Display is turned on during call when phone is on ear. Please, suggest any tip for that or convey the same to Samsung ...",3
"Worst product I ever purchased. Touchscreen sensitivity is poor: I end up having a lot of typos when I type fast, many keys randomly act either sticky or miss. Sometimes the screen doesn't respond at all so that I've to turn off the screen and turn it on again to try again. Also,  the screen has developed a white coloured area along its borders where the sensitivity is almost zero: Can't type 0 or p any more using my favourite keyboard,(typing this using Samsung's crappy keyboard which places both letters slightly differently. But it delivers two p's instead of one). A visible scratch like mark is developed in the bottom right corner of display (beneath the screen). GPS is faulty. Camera is below average and it can't handle low light despite the claim. Only thing good about this phone is its massive battery but to make the most use out of it, I had to remove or disable numerous bloatware first.",1
"If you go only Samsung brand so it's phone is good
brand is not important for you than You will find many options in the market in this price

Fingerprint is slow
camera is not very good but not bad also is good
battery life is also good but Moisture  charging problem many time",3
"The product is overall mediocore
cheap facility in the price possible.
Sound quality of music very bad. sound box not good.
need to restart phn before whatsapp video calling. Auto brightness become non functional after one month of using.
if u have a budget of 13k then buy realme 3 pro( compared).
or some other brand.
samsung is not just worth the money.
I am very sad with this product.",3
"Just after the return window closed, my phone started hanging. On a regular basis. I'm serious. Also, the screen is sometimes to smooth to be typed on. Makes it inconvenient to type what I intend to type with any accidental touches.
It's been few weeks now, the speaker has stopped working.",1
"I am an old customer of amazon..

Now let me tell u 1 thing they have delivered me the defective piece . And when I opted for replacement they started saying that there is no issue in the phone. But my phone networks always remains at 1 strength which stops me from using net properly...

Also they said that as my phone passed the blancco test and there is some issue in network provider, therefore they will not initiate the replacement process..

I talked to every network providers that I use, they all said that there is no use in there network.

Let me make u clear that i tried the sim cards in different phones and they showed great network strength and speed was also good.",1
First thing I hate Samsung mobile.no new features.touch sensitivity average quality.when u slide the screen it not working properly.finger print sensor so ridiculous it's lock properly but unlock not working.games like asphalt 8&9not running.my suggestions don't buy low end phones from Samsung because no new features.my own experience in buying mobile in Amazon not so good.before I also buy a Moto g5s plus from Amazon that was faulty mobile giving by Amazon and now the Samsung m20.i never buy any mobile from Amazon.,1
"The best thing about this phone is Samsung One UI. It gives you a premium experience on such a low budget.About its fingerprint reader its not that fast but it gets the job done and it have 2 camera lens setup one is normal one and other it ultra wide, yup ultra wide which is very rare at this point so u can take ultra wide clicks and Battery life is the best at this price point having 5000mah and it does support quick charge and the best thing is Samsung has also provided Quick charger with this, there are no headphones included in the box itself , you can use two 4g sims and a micro sd card expandable upto 128gb all together.So my final verdict for this phone is:
If you want to use this phone for day to day task it's a good choice at this price
If you want to use this phone for playing graphic intensive games the cpu and gpu will get heated up after sometime.",3
"There is a hidden app pre installed in this device which constantly shows popups ads, which are very irritating and makes phone laggy. Fingerprint scanner is little bit slow bu it works it doesn't unlock phone directly you have to slide up again after pressing on fingerprint scanner to unlock the phone. Camera is ok, I liked dual camera feature. I am giving this phone 1 star even though it deserve 3 stars. I will not change it to 3 star until i get to fix that popup ads problem.",1
"It's been only 11 days since I purchased this phone and I'm already facing major performance and severe UI issues( phone restarts automatically, many play store apps like what's app and youtube don't start until you restart the phone, the phone hangs on multiple occasions).
Amazon cc say they can't help me since I'm past my 10 day period( which is precisely the time it takes for the UI to warm up )  so I've to visit the service centre and have no assurance that these issues won't reappear.
But the major concern is that if I'm already facing these problems you can imagine that after several months I'll be facing mountains of problems regarding UI and if the issues persist I'll probably end up buying a new device since my entire day depends on the proper functionality of my phone.
So be advised UI is the MOST important spec of a phone, and without that you've just got a defected phone with a good battery.
Amazon cc - I always trusted Amazon because of the obsession you show towards your customers but you've left me helpless with the most significant spending I've done on this  app. Any help regarding replacement ( and I do need it ) will be greatly appreciated.",1
"I bought this phone, and the used with one sim for 1 day when i try to change my sim card it ask for security encrypted pin number, I was not even understand what it is and I entered my screen lock pin and locked completely and now asking for MUK CODE, I dont have any clue where can I get that code and how to unlock, they didnt mention anything about this lock system in product description.. Wasted my money...",1
"I have bought this phone 2 days ago and find out phone/camera/sound/screen light quality is VERY VERY POOR. If you are planning to buy this phone please don't buy.
Amazon.in don't have any policy to return/replace the mobile phone. As they have sold now you it's your headache to fix it. or go to service center.
I have called amazon customer service but they not ready to replace or return.
In the website they have mentioned to replacement but they are not ready to replacement.

Might be Amazon.in is selling manufacturer DEFECTIVE /REFURBISHED PRODUCT. So PLEASE BE CAREFUL BEFORE BUYING ANY PRODUCT FROM AMAZON.IN.

Now AMAZON is not trustworthy wrt product quality. as they are selling manufactured defective item.",1
The battery life is good. Camera quality for this segment is better and speed is ok. But when we use in outdoors the heat it produces is tremendously high and even if the phone slips from a very small distance the display will fail making you to spend extra 5000rs for new display fitting. This phone has really a very bad glass quality. So if you think you can keep it like a diamond you can go for it. Or don't,2
"Ok ok below average phone for normal use only. But if you want to buy and use it like a normal only waste of buying then if you are a gamer then it  is out of question. below average mobile. Because initially 5000 mah battery life they given but battery backup was not coming properly. I am able to identify easily after 45 days :(. Now it was not that much matter display also very bad guys even I had tempered glass it was broken.

For good and consistent Go for One plus only (NEVER SETTLED) good tagline. Also don't go for MI also. Even it will tell to give  48 mp but quality wise it will be far less than 48, 4GB RAM they mention but while you are using you can get to know easily. This was my opinion. If real me was good go for it(I DON'T KNOW ABOUT REAL ME). I don't have idea on real me Mobiles. Asus and Moto if series or mobile was then after check reviews in YouTube and critics then blindly go for it(EVEN I AM NOT AN USER OF ASUS AND MOTO).  But don't go for Samsung. While thinking that company have MORE SERVICE CENTRES.  THANKS for the patience to read my review. Don't go for Samsung company mobiles. Blindly Don't go for this company because it has more service CENTERS.
 2 star is for less price.
TAGLINE : SAMSUNG IS VERY MUCH BETTER AND BEST FOR SAMSUNG BASIC MOBILES. I am using it and playing catches that much worth.",3
"Good phone for basic - users. Unlike other phones, Samsung didn't cheat on its dual cam. Speaker is awesome.Too loud in call speakers (front facing). Samsung could have included EIS. Cam quality cheated me. Hot rod iron box on pubg. Samsung didn't do well in battery. A lot of bloatware and samsung is trying to implement the ad services, that Xiaomi and other company uses along with google ads, fb ads etc., To earn after purchase (risking customer's privacy).
The reason I gave 4 star is that... I gave the phone to my Mom, who only calls and text. Thus the phone can be used as a basic phone, regardless of the spec, if you use it a basic phone with cam, Its better.",3
"Review after 2 month of use
1. Battery 4 star work nice
2.Hanging touch problem- hang phone when u use do some surfing on net
3.Brightness auto function is very bad
4. No led fuction for notification
5. Face not recognize untill u see on camera or hold constantly veřy bad
In short not recommened to any other user
After 1 yr use...
No proper touch work
Face reading work only after 5 sec hold",1
"The right sidealphabets display in internet is not working.  I am too old to go around  your samsung service rooms.
........I need a replacement...........

Don't  tell me to go to  your showrooms/service stations.
 If i  have that much energy i would have purchased from the shop.",1
"I hardly write reviews about products but felt like putting this out there. This is an okish sort of product. Do not expect it to outperform its competitors,because it does not. The only usp this product has that makes people want to buy it is the Samsung batch. After using it for a month, I can honestly tell that this phone is not the best investment I made. It hangs abruptly and every now and then it lags. Battery life is good but if you expect Samsung to deliver you a premium product then don't fool yourself. Better to invest your money elsewhere or save and get a better phone. Also the system shows warning of moisture in the usb port and every now and then it does not charge. Honestly read the good reviews and fell for it. My bad",3
"Average mobile. Negative points that I experienced are (a)- finger print not work perfectly specially with moistured finger and location and design of the same also not perfect , one cant assume the exact location for use.
(b) heavy weight phone, one cant hold with single hand for a long time.
(c) camera is also average cant capture the picture if there is any movement in between.
(d) night mode got after updation version 9.0 but it perfectly works with its own basic apps only like contact, message, home screen etc. But doesnt work competely with another apps installed in phone like whatsapp, youtube, chrome etc.

Rest is ok for an average phone user...",3
"My personal recommendation is to never go for Samsung's low budget phones. M20 looks are so awesome but the performance is really bad. Within a week my phone's battery started heating up and call earpiece censor stopped working. Pathetic phone from Samsung.

4GB RAM is for namesake, facial unlock, fingerprint unlock and all other apps open slow. And the built in apps is of no use which consumes the internal storage.

On my personal advice, please do not purchase. Prefer latest redmi phone.",1
"It hasn't even been 2 months since i bought this phone and it is already sitting in the service centre because my earphone jack is not working. This is unacceptable from such a huge brand , we pay money and then get harassed because our products dont match the level of standards they should. If you people cannot make good quality products kindly shut down production instead of harassing people like this. The service centre people kept me waiting for 3 hours before telling me that they wont be able to repair my phone today itself. Is that right? The phone also has heating problems , the battery life is just wayyy below standard. 5000 Mah , was it? I don't think so. This product is so not worth it. Just a piece of advice , if you people don't work on the quality of the products you sell , the dooms day is just around the corner.",1
"Hello guys , i am vipin and i recently bought m20 3gb + 32gb variant, on month ago , the mobile looks beautiful, stunning and perfect handy. Its not so big and comfortably come in hand ,
The screen is nice and blue light filter feature is also provided , the notch gives perfect look to mobile.
 The camera quality is good for rear but not for front camera , the night vision quality is bad for both front and rear .
Fingerprint sensor is not so fast but good in this price range as it not works if you have wet hands, the most powerful feature of this mobile is its battery backup which is awesome , with one time charging i complete my whole one day
As with the price all the features comes in 10k with Samsung like brand so i bought this , i think if you are not a pubg player then this mobile is perfect for you",3
"The phone works great...
Battery life is good ... 1½ day at ease ...
Games go good ..
The only problem is camera ....
The clarity of the front and back camera is not good ... My old Moto X play has a better camera than this...
Front camera is also not good ... Blurry n pixelated pics !

If buying for camera, don't go for it...
Rest its good!",3
"main highlight of this phone is battry.. other feature is good but not better then redmi, real me,asus,honor,... desgin s ok ok.. n th end m nt recommend to buy this phone bcz thr s so many othr phones available in the market online and offline... Real me 3 pro and redmi note 7 pro is best under 15k",3
"5000ma battery but require charge within 20 hrs. with very less phone calls , only mobile data & location on WhatsApp use 2/3 times in a day only . Getting very hot during charging / long time talk .  I previously using Microsoft Lumia 640 XL from April 2015 Its 3000ma battery still running more than 2 days .
  If you want to buy it for battery back up like me then forget M20 or  6000ma M30.",3
"M20 is nice phone
Finger print reader is not fast but ok....

Camera is not best in class compare other competitors like redmi 7 or realme 3...

Batter life is too good...

I will got Samsung one UI update on M20 before week...nice improvement...
But little bit laggy...need further improvement for update hope soon....

Over all nice product

Only Samsung lover....",3
"A capable phone from samsung stable. Here is my review after 5 months use:

Display: impressive v notch display
Battery: superb 5000mah battery. Lasts for 1.5 days on mixed use
Camera: Camera is on the average side both front and back. Filter effects are good in the app.
Finger print reader: works like charm
Performance: Really good. Very less hang ups.

Overally it is a good buy and I am quite happy with it given the price and features.",3
"My Mobile was getting heated while charging and also while viewing. It stopped working after getting heated up today (14 Apr), exactly for 16 days it worked. Unfortunately Amazon has given only 10 day period for returning. Not understanding what to do. Camera is just normal. Battery life as of now is very good.",3
"Got it for 10,790 instead of 13,990 therefore  WAS very happy.
A friend of mine who deals in phones told that you will regret.
N YES I REGRET BUYING THIS PHONE.
Above all , THEY WONT RETURN IT , will just make you fool.
It's damn poor quality phone. Very poor. Camera reminds days of 2 mp n even of VGA era. Very poor quality camera.
Heats very quickly within 10 mins of continuous talking or playing videos for 15 mins.
Above all, it hangs continuously.
Network issue also.
I am not a gamer. I rarely get time to use this phone and whenever I use it, I use very carefully.
If it's having hanging pbl with me then trust me guys this phone is really poor.
BEWARE guys, never fall for 5000 mah battery or large screen. You will also sell it on olx as I'm doing",1
"Camera quality:- front camera- very poor quality as compared with other brands in this range segment, night selfi is very very poor as like multimedia phone
Rear camera- ok but not satisfy
Battery life is good
Display is very poor
Fingerprint is not faster but ok
Hanging problem in very normal use
Conclusion:-
U can't satisfy after buying this phone
I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED BY THIS SAMSUNG PHONE",2
"After using this mobile for 20 days here are my reviews-
1. Mobile face security is worsr one i.e u can open face security via picture or in closed eyes.
2. Battery performance is not good as it is 5k mah.
3. Build quality is not good.
4. Mobile phone is thick it is not look like as the pictures shown on amazon.
5. Privacy lock for app is not and option in mobile.. u have to download from google play i.e app lock etc.
6. Gaming is same as on the other mobiles.
7. Pics or videos quality are not good when light is low.
8. A liitle bit hang issue.

And the Most important thing is NETWORK issue...  Network catching power is very poor

So u can go for MI, Opppo and other brands instead of samsung",2
"Much ad of this Samsung Galaxy M20, but in reality it's a bad phone. I am a regular user of RedMi phones, but for the first time I had planned to purchase Galaxy 20 but now I am realising the decision was wrong.
Pros:
Size of the phone is good only.

Cons:
- Voice quality average
- Audio quality bad
- Video quality just average
- System is not responsive.
- Camera is poor, a basic camera.
- No recording icon appears while dialing or receiving a call.
- Touch is average.",2
"I have purchased this product on February 28th. Due for a system update tomorrow. In these days of usage, this is my review.

Pros:
Good video viewing experience. 3/5
Good outdoor camera. 3/5
Battery charging and related 4/5
My usage needs me to charge once every two days and it's so relieving.

Cons:
Terrible indoor pictures

Below avg selfie camera

Screen lags like an old phone while switching between apps. This is not what I expected from a 4GB phone. I use WhatsApp, YouTube and Instagram and even those apps are not running as smoothly as I had expected.

I was looking forward to using a premium Samsung phone but so far, I feel I have overpaid for these features.

I hope the latest update changes my mind.",3
"I can't believe even Samsung make this type of waste product
Very bad battery life
Camera quality is just good
Software is so bad
I go 5 to 6 time service centre regarding services
Samsung change display fingerprint reader even change charging port ok but the product is not ok I want my money back but after 3 months of use it not possible",3
"It is the worst processor I have ever seen...
Often I am facing the HANGING problem only with the basic apps installed..
Face detection is the worst one. It will work only in the first setting environment.  If any small changes in the visibility also it won't work. Finger print detection is very slow compared to other smartphones.
The display is very fragile (without protection) for even small vibrations ..
The only best thing is the battery life. But it takes more than 2hours for full charging...

I strongly recommend not to buy it in the name of brand. If you do so , then you will have to pay for it......",1
"Samsung is selling this online on low price. Same model with another name and higher rate is available in show rooms. So they are given worst quality product online purchase as within 20 days, screen stopped working and was not able to return this due to 14 days return policy. This was one of the worst online experience where you paid for good product and getting product which does not survive even for 20 days. Samsung has compromised with quality for low online rate. Tried calling customer care. They had also refused to return. Took that to one service centre they had factory reset the phone and returned. It was not working at all.",1
I am very disappointed with the service of Amazon. My mobile is not working properly. I want to replace the same. But while the tecnician so detailed by Amazon visited my home to inspect the phone declared that there is no problem. As such the phone is not replaced by Amazon. I am a regular customer of Amazon. But this is first time I am experienced the very very poor service policy from Amazon. So I am bound to think to purchase any thing from Amazon in future. Sory to say again I am Very very disappointed from the service of amazon. I am not expecting such type of service from Amazon.,1

Weight is bit Heavy but this is okay since 5k  battery..
And most importantly the brightness sensor has some delay in action and mallfunctioning and the light notification is missing.",2

Phone is good. But I face little hang issue. And camera quality is good but some time it's half screen seems yellow and half blue effect. One of the most major issue I face within 2ndday of purchasing is automatically click whole screen. I didn't touch the phone and it click here there everywhere. It's too difficult to switch off that time. But I face it one time. Overall the phone is good.,3
"Worst product and that too coming from Brand like Samsung.
No Pros, only Cons for this mobile device. So called unbreakable phone started giving issue with its pixels without any physical damage.
-It started with frequent prompt of ""Moisture being detected at USB/Charging port"" . This came as complete shocker, as device was not even moist or came in contact with any water particles.
- post couple of days of prompt, device started losing its pixels without any physical damage to the screen.
- Recent scenario is device is behaving weirdly without any physical damage to the screen.
-Samsung service center is not ready to accept the complaint or even ready to take a look at the reported issue.
-Being launched recently, Samsung are not prepared at all with the device or services.
-Same issue has been detected with M30 which was purchased by my friend.
-At the end, post 3 month of purchase, I am being told to fixed the display even thought there is no issue with display.
-Rs 13,000 purchase now giving additional Rs 4000 of expense despite of any issue.
- Samsung service center or customer support are of no use.

-- I would suggest to go with Moto or Mi for the purchase instead of this poor device and so called Samsung Brand.",1
"Worst camera quality.
Low sound.
Processing dam slow.
Hang problem.
Screen shaking issue.no notification LED.
Battery charging takes 4-5 hours for 100% I don't understand how they are saying fast charger facility.
Performance lacking while using multiple apps together.Bricghtness reduces randdomly even if using any app.
Overall it's a Worst product.
Samsung making fool to people's.",1
"I bought this phone about 20 days back , and I am a heavy user of the phone, though I am not gadget freaky still I am able to realize soon that this phone is not the best, However some one who is looking for budget phone and samsung brand may go with it. Majorly the phone is lagging in processor. Phone hangs quite often , even to make a phone call you will have to wait for at least 10 seconds.  Voice clarity is  good , photo clarity is good, sound is good.  It has got shiny finish which make it look rich when holding I must Say battery backup is Awesome, It can easily last nearly 24 to 18 hrs when fully charged with relatively good usage . not recommended for heavy users .",3
"Very bad experience with Samsung again with the smart phones. Its totally unexpectable experience. I have purchased this phone in mid February and its mid August now and phone screen got damaged without any physical contact. Screen is not working properly. Have asked the problem to Samsung care but the solutions they have suggested is not fulfill my expectations. They have suggested to visit Samsung care stores for the same. And i am sure after visiting there the store guy will ask you for the high money for the replacement and all and they will blames to the customers only. I don't know why Samsung is making smart phones if they can't make a good one.

I would like to request kindly return my phone please. I don't want this any more now.",1
Hi ..I hv been using this phone for more then 1 month...nd this phone  is fine for normal users..but for people  who are always  on their phones nd specifically  who play games...screen touch does not work some time  game playing gets awful ...heavy games lags..some water got splashed on my screen was gone instantly...although I dried it up instantly but screen caused problem again....,2
Value for money but tough to use. Not recommended for those switching from iOS. Also too big to hold but good to watch big screen. Camera seems good. Extra samsung skin is a low with galaxy store but 5k mAH battery is what you look at when you opt for this phone which is worth.,3
"Not a worthy product:
1. Touch is not so good need to press it 2-3 times to do any task.

2. Facing network with this product .

3. Battery life seems to be ok

4. Facing heating issue

5. This product is So heavy i have to use my hands to handle it. Can't use it with hand

6. Hangs some times

Please don't buy this not worth it",1
" I've got a defective piece.  The phone starts to work by itself. The touch isnt working.the problem is so worse that I've to restart the phone inorder to make the issue stop . Tried using it in safe mode but the problem still persists . Might be another product for Amazon but feels really disappointed when your first phone is defective .
REALLY  DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!",1
"Worst phone that I bought ever.
Samsung has lost its creditability.
I bought this a month ago n today can't even multitask n it's software is crashed.
I can't even open my pho e now.its restarting on its own again n again.
I hv no idea why this is happening.
I had lots of hope but now m jus regretting the moment when I decided to buy it.

My suggestion don't waste your money.",1
"The touch sensitivity  is pathetic of this phone, sometime  it does not even respond to your touch for a while. happened many times. very disappointed with this one. Worst phone i have ever used out of 7-8. The touch of this screen is so pathetic that you have to press hard like cell phones of earlier times.
1) Not so fast charging, takes at least 2 hours to fully charge. and battery back up is also less.",1
"On the 11th day, i started facing issues (frequent POP up of overheating and phone getting off), i approached Samsung service center as Amazon 10 days return window was over, upon diagnosis they said that the mother board has to be replaced and it is not in stock. Request to samsung and Amazon for replacement was denied.

i was all time samsung user, but after this i will not as they have degraded the product quality in view of cut throat competition with other manufacturer.

EDIT : Upon writing an email to Samsung directly, they have instructed the service center to resolve the issue on priority by replacing the mother board. It is one month now after replacement, so far phone is working fine, would like to add two more star for samsung prompt action and close follow up with the service center.",3
"I have a purchased Samsung M20 at first sale from Amazon.The day i received it i was excited but as i start doing charging phone ,charger does't work i shocked the brand Samsung can have such fault in its new M20 phone charger .When i check it the problem was in C cable which is not working . Buying a Online Phone is creating some bad experience to me ,i will think 20 times when i will purchase any thing from online sites .",2
"Power On Phone - After initial setup, See Charge at 50% - Put Charge at 7.00 PM - After one hour 57%, Very poor charging - Changed Power Socket and verified at 12 Mid Night - After 5 hours, 47% Charging Done - I purchased three Mobile this year, This Samsung M20 is Very Poor in Batter Charging - Certified technician visited from Amazon, Did nothing and keep saying ""You need to charge initially for 6-8 hours"" - Reported to Amazon again and Waiting for Another Technician to do REAL Troubleshooting - Brand New Phone taking 5 hours for 47% charging is Very Bad for Product as well for the Seller Amazon - Thank You",2
Worst product from Samsung. I have had to replace the display within 6 months of purchase and no I have not even dropped the phone once. This phone is unable to bear the 5000 maH battery and this is leading to the display being cracked. On top of it service is asking to pay 4500 to get the display changed. No surity being provided if the new display will be better. Think twice before buying.,1
Been using samsung for past 5 years with higher price range. When they launched M20 i was very happy to see samsung coming up with mid range mobiles that too with a premium notch. its been 10 days since i purchased M20. On the day i got mobile in hand that is the only day it worked well. Rest is history. Heard people saying samsung has a lagging issues but personally i never agreed coz i use samsung high range mobile it never lags. But this mobile is total waste by samsung. To tackle Mi's mid range mobile they started this. One advice to those who are looking to purchase this better choose a button mobile rather than choosing this. Waste of money. it irritates you by opening all the applications by itself. highly disappointed.,1
"The product is very worst...battery life is not that good ..the cell comes with 5000 mah battery
 But the charging remains only for a day or sometimes even less than that ...the back of sumsung M20 is seriously of very cheap quality... if the cell is used without a cover u can easily see number of scratches on the back ...within the purchase of 2 months my phone starting hanging.. while using the phone, automatically phones screen  start  scrolling up and down , keyboard appears and automatically starts the typing and many more things ...am fed up with this product  ....

Guys its a suggestion pllzzzzz don't buy this.. Other companies phone  are much more better than samsung.. its literally waste of money ...",3
"It’s not a good phone everything is substandard quality, camera is with high resolution but the picture quantity is not good it lacks in sharpness,
Phone becomes hot after after of usage
Basically we all have habit of doing multi tasking and this phone cannot handle it, meant for 1 application at a time",1
"I have purchased this mobile 10 days before and for initial 3-4 days it was working fine.
But after that i found an issue with the touch of device. It got stuck on many application screens. Even scrolling was very poor.

To be honest no one can play PUB G on this device. After installing PUB G, it almost stop working and it was difficult to use this device. It auto type anything on the screen.

After contacting customer care of Amazon they said , it is a hardware issue and it FAILED on touch test. I got my replaced hardware and will update the performance of that soon.
I am very disappointed with SAMSUNG. I have used many phones from SAMSUNG but never found such poor performance and user experience.",1
"I have brought samsung galaxy m20 from amazon on 01Apr2019 .
1. Fingerprint scanner is not good quality as compared with other company mobiles on that price range.
2. Rear camera is ok but front camera is not enough good as i expected also unable to read face to unlock in  1st attempt.
3. As battery is 5000mAh but after full charging is not lasting for 18-30 hours if i use 8- 9 hours in a day.
4. Foremost thing is that my mobile hanging just after buying and using of 04 months so processor is not good as i expected as 03GB ram of this mobile. So i giving 2 star to m20.
5. Looks and display good.
6. One headphone may be provide with this mobile if can not give a good mobile on that ptice range. Thank you",2
I am writing this review after using it for 5-6 month. I have also shared review after using in for couple of week. Battery performance has degraded too much. Initially it used to take 2 hrs for 100% chanrging now it is taking more than 4hrs. It stops detecting sim intermittently and sometime it happens during the call. Not good phone to buy and very much disappointed feom Samsung as i have used couple of other model in past but this is really bad product. They try to design product with advance feature in low cost but seems like they failed.,1
"Hi All,

I would like to inform that I have ordered M20 Samsung phone as on 07.02.2019 and it starts showing problem, not even passed over 6 months. it is not taking charging , showing error of Moisture detected at usb port. Let's it dry first.
There is 44 C temperature at Delhi, how moisture could be detected . even it's not raining. At the time of monsoon it seems it will die.
 Not good product.

This is my first phone ordered online through amazon. In future I don't want to do it again,

Good investment went wrong , so sad

Thanks for listening me.",1
"I bought this phone after reading all the specifications and it was up to the mark for me.. But after 2 weeks use..i found that i did a very big mistake..
Cons:
Its touch is not up to the mark..
The network connection is so poor..u will feel dipressed after buying this phn.. The reception is that much bad the phn will like a dbba without network..
Very bad experience with samsung..
GO FOR REDMI INSTEAD OF SAMSUNG..",1
"Over all good product from the given price range.

Good part:
Battery life, weight, sound quality, OS, dedicated slot for memory card, ease in using n guide populate, storage is good, auto cleaning processes run daily so memeory cleaning automatically, back camara pic quality is good

Things which i feel not upto mark:
Selfie camara picture quality even when light is proper, performance is low.. when u open browse u can see dual time flicker, when do fast type smasung keyboard hangs or showing diff characters like we r getting when do long press, while incoming call u can see transition from number to name having contact list near 300 numbers. Surfing gallery leads slow thumbnail",3
"Don't buy.
1. Weak Processor, Hanging issue
2. Network Issue
3. Touch isn't up to the mark
4. Sometimes camera button doesn't work
5. Camera blurs the edge of the photo
6. No notification light.
7. Too much bloatwares. Only 1 GB RAM free to use.
8. Fingerprint sensor and other functions are very slow. Redmi is much faster than it.
9. No Multy Screen option after 1st update.
10. No default app lock system like j7 Prime.

Galaxy j7 Prime is far better than it in Touch, Speed, Multy screen and app lock facility..

Samsung ruined the M20 series in its opening. Samsung must have used Snapdragon processors. Want to replace it but days are over..",1
"Advantage:
Superb phone except camera. Software is so good. You cannot off data, switch off your phone unless you unlock your phone. It's easy to track your phone while missed. Charging while power save mode gives faster charging. The UI design is very well. It gives you full access to zoom your video across notch. Dual messenger also great option. Great battery life.

Disadvantages:
Photo lovers don't buy this phone. Worst camera. Especially front camera. Never expected such a cheap thing from Samsung. At least Samsung have to give update for camera and photo clarity. All other smartphone users using pie version Android. But we have to wait upto August. Face recognition also worst. Finger print only we can use three fingers print.",3
"Good Things.
The only thing good is the battery life.Phone charges fully in 2 hrs

Bad Things
Within 2 months phone started to slow down
Fingerprint scanner is average when new but becomes very slow in a week.
Late updates to the phone.security updates come 2 months late
Camera quality average..no option for slo mo or timelapse.
Speaker is relatively better than other samsung phones
Google maps works great.
Some minor issues with mobile network and data of jio.
Phone is very heavyweight bulky and thick.",2
"If i compare from 1+ 5t, Speaker could have been louder, it is half of 1+... I know the cost is different for both but just u understand on the difference in speaker output... Camera is average, though wide angle view is good option...
Given 4 rating because with the cost is 10000, this is what is expected...so its a good buy considering the cost ..",3
Please don't buy this product totally waste of Money. I'm using this device since 1 week and facing many issues in this device. Again i'm telling you don't go with M 20.,1
"Very poor experience...after 20 days it showing black spot on the lower side of the screen.
Even when i went to service centre to show & replace the phone, they said that it dropped by hand even there no schcresh on it. Now what i do???",1
"Device looks, feels, ui is good and looking premium but performance  is not good. I'm not a gaming lover so didn't install a single game but still I facing issues when open 3-4 apps back to back.
I face sluggish performance of device when browsing apps.
Camera still a good side when taking landscapes specially with dual cam. But you have to adjust with a small size image in the same time. Selfie cam is not good it's change a Bhartiya citizen in to a French citizen... means it's apply lots of brightness, glow with default settings.
Battery is good, it's easily work for me 1 and half day.
Device vibration is poor. You didn't feel vibration even in your denim pockets.",3
"What is this? this product is damaged. Not working properly.
Annoying to me for Device Overheating. still, i did not installed any big applications, Games, or software then also shown me device overheating without anything.
In one day, there are almost 50 to 60 times device switch off automatically for overheating. What is this?
This is not good for my Samsung experience. I don't want to buy Samsung products. So, please help me to solve this problem because i am very tired to seen this issue. Every i faced this overheating problem. Many times doing this problem, When i used some important things or calls or anything then suddenly closed everything and power off. What is this?",1
"Samsung phones are very bad in Sub 10k range.
After few months of usage I have found that Network speed is too low,(at the same time and place other phones perform well)
Touch response is bad too
Phone is sluggish even for basic features like calling
Only positive is battery life is good.
Dont buy from STPL seller they send different color than what is ordered

Please think before buying",1
"Mobile got turned off while using, unable to turn it on.
No physical shocks, No physical damage.

Its exactly 3 months i got this from amazon.
Everything was great for 3 months.

How to avail replacement ?.

Didn't expect this from amazon. I don't want to take it to service center coz if I did so you may come up saying it's warranty void.",1
"Itni badi brand and abhi tak iska hang issues gaya hi nahi. Jabki isse chote brand kitna mast handset nikalte hai jinme hanging issues hai hi nahi.I don't know when hanging issues of Samsung will go away. In today's market samsung is also known as hanging phone.
My Samsung m20 a very new buying hanging most of the time.i really fed up with this issue. I was using earlier oppo set which after 2 years of using not a single time hanged.But Samsung which is very bigger brand disappoint me. Kindly upgrade your os so that my hanging issues will be resolved.",3
"The processor is slow compared to Snapdragon 660.
 PUBG, Asphalt and other high end games lags when you play them on Medium and High Resolution mode.
 Heat  If you play games continuously for an hour or download anything for half an hour then the phone becomes very hot.
You can't return and get the refund onces you buy the phone. Hence I have written this detailed review*
I will suggest not to buy this phone and especially don't buy phones/laptops from Amazon they don't give refund and also ask to install some app checks your phones and tells it's working fine even if it is not (Checked the Play Store reviews). Overall all worst experience with phone and Amazon",1
"Naam bade darshan chote.......
High on specification but low in performance.
Doesn't last whole day with 5000mah battery too.
Heavy in weight, and
 often misbehaves on it's own like some time wont response or would start moving on it's own.
Even the fingerprint sensor isn't that quick and specially if you are out in city with all the pollution it fails.

Such a low loudspeaker seen after a long time.

As basic as alarm cant be heared unless kept very next to your ear.",3
"Its a good phone offered at this price from samsung for the first time but if we compare it to other phones at this price its dosen't stand out any chance.
The camera performance its below average both feont and back and portrait mode and low light sucks. It dosen't even have slow motion and 4k recording support. My 2yrs old moto g5s plus performs better than this which obviously have 4k and slow-mo.
If u are looking for this phone just for camera dont even think about it. Built quality is nice feels decent in hands looks Could have been better.
The one pros of this phone is its battery(5000mah) and usb-c with fast charger.",3
Worst phone ever I saw . There is brand name also. Do not buy. No camara quality . Taking to much time to unlock. battery performance is ok. But there is no quality in this phone. Very local and poor quality Do not buy it pls pls even back case quality is very poor and plastic base. In this price range you can go any other best option in market. With snapdragons processerm,1
"i am using this product for more then 9 months, I've ordered phone in month of march, the product which i recieved  were defected so i exchanged it from amazon (big thumbs up for the services of amazon).

now lets talk about phone.

Battery backup is good.
charging is good.
very good built quality..

worst face unlock,
PUBG lags very much,
not so powerful.
vibration feedback is poor.
heating problem.
fingerprint never unlock the phone in one go.
last update received three months ago.
i have to take it to the service center because i am facing some screen issues...
screen showing prints of previous app.  like ..  it is visible when any app display some thing black on screen.",3
Either it is bandwidth Or something else I don't know what is wrong with samsung. There is always no network Or very less network compare to other brands.although I love samsung previously I had NOTE 5 and On8 they both had same problem. I can only able to internet when good network strength is available. I think samsung will improve this very soon. Rest is very good.,3
"I bought this phone 363 days ago. Like all Samsung phones I have so far used, they seem to go phut in exactly one year or just before the year ends. And the service centers are always out to devise new excuses to deny your warranty or delay it till the year ends and then they throw up their hands. Never buy Samsung phones.",1
"Kindly read the review before purchasing the phone.
Cons,
1. If u r a selfi lover, then don't  go for this phone. Front camera is very dissappointing.
2. Processor- this phone is also have the same problem which other samsung phone having, Processor does not support with all apps and lagging also there.
3. UI - It makes the phone more laggy
4. It supports Indian sim only.

Pros,
1. Good battery life.
2. Rear camera  is good enough to explore
3. Good display clarity.

And the given 2 stars only for calling purpose  ..
Conclusion - totally it is a waste product and the samsung brand also ..
Thanks to amazon .. never repeat this .ok",2
"Though it's 6'' display, they increased the length and reduced the width of the phone. It may be good for entertainments like watching movies, games etc, not upto the level for office purpose usages.  Sound quality is low when compared to the other model phones..",3
"1st thing which disappointed me is the time taken for charging the phone is 3 times more than any phone. It was told that the charging is 3 TIMES fast but in fact its 3 TIMES slow.
Secondly is the display. Display is very very dull even if we have adjusted the phone to the maximum brightness possible the phone display remains very very dull.",3
This product is good in this range but few things needs to.be improved like camera in indoor area isn't good enough also there are a lot or scratches in the back side even I was using a backcover don't know why this is happen I'm using the same material back cover in my another samsun as well but I didn't see any scratches in that also that phone has the same body from the backside don't know why this is happening with this.,2
15 din k anadar phone k display repair krni pdi because it's not working properly. it not my folt why should using a repair phone. China phone b jyada chalta h ye 15 din me toch kaam krna ban kr diya aage kitna pareshan krega. Company give a 10 day replacement but if 12th day facing a problem not able to do anything. Company ka defective peace apana paisa khrch krke kharido aur repair peace use kro. Is se acha second hand phone acha. Naya phone 15 din me bigad jaaye. It's very poor quality,1
Shame on Samsung.  The company drastically need to check its product quality process.  The M20 64GB delivered is a defective piece.  Shown to Customer Care.  It says speaker is not working.  I am shattered.  Is it really a Samsung product.  The very new item going to Customer care before use.  Something really wrong with Samsung.  Want to return the item.  Please suggest.,1
"All the features are good on this budget oriented phone by Samsung.
Note - This review is based on the 15 days usage , as on the 16th day the phone was dead.

what happened ? - The phone was working fine and was super smooth , easy to handle but on the 1th day when I chaged the phone and tried using again - it did not switch on.
On taking the phone to Customer care they said - the mother board needs to be replaced.
On asking for phone replacement, they said as per Samsung company policy they won't do it after 15 days of purchase.

Now only the motherboard was changed - seems to be working fine, but let's see what's up for next.",3
"Bought it for my mom, within a month had problem with the screen, went to Samsung customer service center, it's been 20 days, still no update. They say they've repaired it but still waiting for approval from main office whether to consider the repair under warranty or not.
Highly disappointed with Samsung this time, I'm using m30 and that's working fine, didn't know the customer support is so bad.",1
"This is a descent phone ,yet there are a few problems .
Anything you need to know is listed below:-
THE PROS:- 1) the screen quality is amazing .
2) the battery durability is excellent.
3) overall feel in hand and look is descent.

THE CONS:-1) camera is good but edge detection in portrait mode is not upto the mark.
2) RAM management is silly
3) The processor is suitable for day to day tasks but not for heavy gaming users who play pubg or asphalt 9.
4) fingerprint sensor is really slow, i think it can be improved by further software updates.
5) the animations are a little slower.

Hope you like  it..",3
"I was tieing my shoelace holding my ph in my hand and suddenly in fell on the floor,merely from 5-10 mm and the screen broke.
I bought it just a few days back and this happened.
On contacting Samsung Service centre-They said its not covered and for replacing the screen-I have to pay 4200/- .. i.e. 40% of the actual amount of phone- just for screen replacement.",2
"Review after 6 months of use.
Pros -
There is hardly any pro, altough the phone has 5000 mAH battery,FHD Screen, a good Camera but all these pros have turn into cons now.
Cons -
Battery was good at initial months, can goes upto 1 day and more but drastically it has changed now it does not goes more than 6 hours (I dont play games).
Camera, at starting this phone takes very good pictures infact my phone was specially required for taking selfies and images, but camera quality has decreased. Now images taken by the camera is just  normal and selfies are the worst.
Processor - It is the worst. Samsung please use processors of snapdragon. Exynos sucks. My new phone started hanging and nowdays this lagging sickness is going unbearable. Sometimes I want to toss this device with my full energy.
Exchange value - The value of exchange of 6 months of phonen is 3200 rupees. I have purchased for 12000",2
"The worst part if M20 is camera. The images are not clear,  enhanced with inbuilt software. Battery is good. It got hang many times while opening many apps at the same time. 4G Modem has no good quality , always a problem to connect while in low signal areas. While using it as dual sim , the performance of call connect is poor. Overall ,I am not satisfied with device.in the same process range quality if Redmi 6, 7 pro is much better.",3
samsung ke M20 me bohot hang hota hai. i buy samsung m20 by seeking some froad and selfish youtubers like technical guruji and some others but i get stuck. i also receive some feeling of nationality topics like they said samsung make all their manufacturing in india but MI made in china. My MI 3s prime is better than samsung M20. now i think what i need to do next.  i want to know that can i return the product?  i was only distracted by these selfish youtubers. i also blocked their channels if i saw any froad comes from them. now i am focussed to buy the redmi note 7 pro. lets thinks what i get from them.,1
"As per my review this device is best for Samsung lover in affordable price even I not much liked it because I am not Samsung lover. In 1 or 2 month Samsung drop the mobile price. The Camara quality is not too good and live focus (blur) is worth feature in camera.
Battery life as compare to another Samsung phone is good but if we compare to another brands the 5000 mAh like 3500 mAh. Not more than 8 -10 hours. Even the phone battery reduces 5-10% in night when phone has no use.

Second The plastic body will get scratches soon. The screen is not too good.

Fast charging like hehehhehe .",3
"Average mobile ,fingerprint sensor is slow, processor is also slow , u can easily feel delay in opening files , display touch response is also slow ..... Slow charging takes 6 hours to charge full ...... Mobile is very bulky & heavy.
Sound quality good . Display quality average, colors are dull ,not expressive ......
If you want good performance & speed than don't buy Samsung M20",1
"Overall it packs almost everything you get in this budget or may be a little less (little cost also goes for brand name)

Display is really good.
5000 mAh is good to have but I expected little more backup with this.
Camera is also good as per budget.

Cons:
1. Phone became slow after using 3-4 weeks, application start time and switching time is increased.
2. The signal receiving strength is little less, sometimes face problem in connecting to internet when indoor or at roof top which wasn't case with my old phone with same service provider.
3. Few applications like Google map and Facebook crashes when directly opened from notification bar to see some notification.",3
"Samsung as the history suggests.. they are not good at low cost handsets. Bought this phone with great anticipation and above other brands who were offering same specifications at better price but im disappointed. Fingerprint scanner, face scanner takes ages to recognise and unlock. Its been 2 months i am using this phone and it has started to hang like anything. Using only basic apps like fb, chrome and whatsapp along with calls consumes so much battery that i have to charge it daily before EOD even though it says 5000 mah.
I would again suggest to go for other brands in this price range and consider samsung for their high end phones only.",3
"All the feature like screen resolution, sound, picture etc are good. But, the thing is, when playing PUBG it is so lag that you will not able to point your enemy when using any type of sight. I think it's because of the processor or something went wrong to something or miss.
Even if your internet connection is good. Samsung, can you fix it please....

Sometime it makes me so angry that I want it to throw away. Any how, others are working well.

It's just not meant for playing PUBG.

Thank you..",1
"I am disappointed with both Amazon and Samsung. First Amazon delivered this phone one day late and their customer service response was poor. Second, I feel that Samsung has launched an inferior product. A 4 GB RAM with only 25 GB filled storage of 64 GB available hangs almost 5 times in a day. My phone is only 1 month old. I dont play any pubG kind of game. Only small games. Disappointed",2
"Brought this as my first Samsung smartphone.  Worst product ever used as compared to other brands.  Can't install apps from play store as it shows download pending.  Without installing any apps,  it used 11gb out of my 32 gb.  Also some of the rarely used apps can't be uninstalled.  I want to return this product but don't have such option.  The appearance may look good.  But due to technical faults I would like to rate it 4/10.",1
"I hope it was worst cellular phone released by Samsung.

The Front camera was pathetic , Battery is not upto the mark as Mentioned by Samsung and most disaster is phone is getting heated while using Maps, Charging, Social Media Apps. Finger Print sensor is taking too much time for unlocking

I suggest its a waste of money for purchasing this mobile.",1
"I bought this phone for my old father few months back and now its getting hang several times a day and its also he is facing problem to charge this phone, when he tried to contact service center nearby the are asking for so much amount thinking he is old man they are trying to mislead him.. When i check rates for repair with other shops they asked for very cheap prices.... Very poor service by Samsung very disappointed!!!!
I opted for Samsung considering that it has got good customer care but i made big mistake..... Please don't go for this brand or this phone!!!!",1
"i will suggest everyone to go with any other brand. Samsung is showing that they are giving so much features at this price just to compete with other companies. actually there are many faults in this phone. In M20 you cannot dekete the whatsapp statuses those are saved in your phone memory. You cannot remove them anyway from the phone and the storage space get consumed day by day and you are unable to use one single app after some days. Samsung is making people fool just to compete with other brands. they actually are unable to give similar features at this affordable price those which other brands are giving,that's why they are cheating",2
"Overall good phone.. not for youngsters definitely but good for parents because heavy user youngsters will find this phone boring.. also for youngsters who are casual users eg. Whatsapp, music, calls & casual games etc.. little bit problem with touch means touch is slow compare to many other phones but i guess it will be fixed. on continuous usage there is some heating issue. Otherwise Battery is BOMB!!! Plus you get type C charger which is 1% battery charge in a minute. Camera is also good. speaker also kind of works well. You can definitely go for this phone i would recommend for sure..",3
"Hi, Recently I bought this mobile for my mother which turned out to be an absolute disappointment. Firstly, Camera didn't start at all & after restarting it 2-3 times, it began to work, but God knows, if again it stops functioning. Secondly, Touch screen is not quick responsive, needs to tap hard to open up an app.

In nut shell, I am not very impressed with this model at all. I don't know, is it the Samsung's fault or of some crooked seller. Whatever the reason, Amazon should be little more cautious about this, as this kind of mis-selling practices may cause them dearer, people will think twice before trying out Amazon again.",1
"It's been 3 months now.
Camera is really worst, even Coolpad note 3 is much much better than M30.
Finger print reader slow after 1 month only and still is, same goes for processing speed for other apps, Slow Slow Slow.
Only good thing is the Display & Battery.
Please prefer other, there are better mobile worthier than this for the same price.

"Samsung Galaxy M20
Pros:
Battery is good, phone looks good.
Cons: Touch, fingerprint issues.
My experience: I received the product with is having touch and fingerprint issues. When contacted the customer care, they replaced the product.
One I start using the replacement product, I encountered the touch issues again but fingerprint is good this time. So contacted the customer care. Then they did the testing and gave me an option for return the product.

On overall the amazon customer care and the STPL Exclusive seller is good, but the product is bad.
 Samsung has to maintain their brand level.",1
"Cons:

Very bad rear camera in low light and medium light conditions.picture quality is bad. Cant play pubg smoothly frame drop during gameplay and handset was heated quickly.slight software lag,Sound is ok not that great.network signal strength issue ,I tried with airtel and jio both shows only 2 sticks.

Pros : Fast Charging and Battery Size is Good.Same price you will get Better Options with Other Companies",2

Network reception is poor, it's not show network in remote areas where my friends mobile is showing 2-3 network bars..

"No Pros in this mobile except samsung brand.

Battery life: Not more than 6hrs on normal use.
Mobile hangs too much
I have basic apps for which mobile RAM is full.. after 3years i have purchased samsung because of its new features. But after this.. iam never gonna look back to samsung..gud bye samsung..
I beg everyone who plans to take this mobile.. Never go to samsung. Please.. Or else you will regret like me",1
"It is just an average phone..  performance is below par with competitors.
front camera is below average, and  you  can't play much game on this. rear cam is just average.
bought samsung m20 only because it was for use by elders. otherwise i would have gone for any other brand.",2
"It seems I got a refurbished item which suddenly stopped working. After using a week the phone got turned off automatically and I followed all necessary steps to switch it on but in vain . For this reason I contacted customer service (CS) for replacement. CS placed a request for inspecting the product but again a miracle happened and phone got turned on after 2 days.
 This time I cancelled the replacement request as phone started working. Only God knows, what would happen from now! It's a kinda mystery.

6. Camera not good.
7. When i charged fully to my mobile, i cant use it properly at least for 5 hrs. may be its a battery problem ?
why don't you check and replace with proper one? Please help me.
Customer care peoples also not supported.
1st time I am facing 100%trouble in Samsung mobile. One of the biggest worst mobile.",1
Philosophy is best for Samsung lovers. Camera is average but I like the ultra wide camera. There are high frame drops in pubg after playing two or three matches that you have to restart your phone. Feels good in hand. Bezels are less than Remi note7 pro and screen whale is also better but way brushing in camera angle processor department. If you watching it for gaming then sorry this is not for you. Yes if you prefer Services and screen quality then go for it. It can handle heavily apps for short duration easily. And thanks battery backup is awesome sleigh fast charging but charging full takes time due to large battery size,3
"A great budget phone. As regards to the fingerprint reader,it's not really worth it regarding its quality and speed.the back camera is somewhat good considering the price but that doesn't do for the front. Pictures taken by the front cam looks a bit ""painted"" and not very good for low light selfies. What impressed me was the 5000 Mah battery that last fully through a day with a full charge.you can take it further up using the low power mode and managing your apps judiciously.The phone also gets a bit heated up after longer use at the top part. Overall a good phone for this price for college students and a great budget phone !",3
"Worst quality. Using 40days so far. Not games player and neither heavy  user of apps.. Didn't realize the touch screen issues so many days. I was assuming app issue. You tube maximize option Not working properly. Observed the same behaviour while news browsing.
One day none of the apps I was able to open from shortcut or recent option. I was trying to make payment using pattu in petrol station. Tried opening google pay etc. Went to recent apps. Even there I wasn't able to open any app. SIMPLY MY TOUCH WAS DUMB.
Touch screen Not working correctly.
Didn't expect this quality from Samsung after spending Rs.13k.",1
"Really pathetic service by Amazon which was not expected.
I got a defective Samsung Galaxy M20 as I am not able to update any of software and apps,  while trying for a replacement for that defective product Amazon executive asked me to register for a technical check appointment for the device and I was ready to go for that but again with Amazon technical glitz I was not able to get any slots..  I mean if we have to replace a defective item why we have to suffer then much process.. Which one turn doesn't work.
Amazon need to work on this and provide efficient solution.",1
"I received used broken product. Then I informed it to the Amazon.in and they promised me to send new mobile for me. I received new mobile after 5 days. Mobile is good. Selfie ""camera quality"" is better than rear one. ""Battery life"" , display, touch, ""fingerprint reader"" is the best. If you are not using mobile phone for PUBG then go for it. PUBG के अलावा भी दुनिया होती है l

In the box = mobile handset, charger, and user manual..... No backcover, No screengaurd, no earphones..",3
"Good fingerprint reader but bad camera, i am using this phone since last 2 months i newer find a single good pic in low light, and selfie in night is just a blurred photo. Its dual camera change straight objects photo in curved one. Galaxy j5 2014 camera was much more better than this m20 phone camera.
Features mentioned are good but they don't work properly.
Its 5000mah battery is equivalent to 4000mah of other any phone in this range.
If i compare this m20 phone with my previous galaxy j5 phone, Samsung made me fool.
But still i am using it because i am happy with Samsung's display and sound quality",3
"I purchased the product on 5th Feb, writing review on 21st may.
Pros: good display, good UI, good ram management,  excellent battery, decent camera.
Cons:
The first and the foremost quality of any MOBILE PHONE IS TO MAKE PHONE CALLS, AND THIS HAS THE WORST, IT FAILS TO MAKE CALL IN FIRST ATTEMPT MOST TIMES, I NEED TO RESTART TO GET NETWORK. EVEN WHEN IM STANDING NEAR THE TOWER. IT DOES NOT EVEN CATCH THE 4G NETWORK.
Sometimes fails to detect finger print.
Bad speakers, not even properly audible in full volume. On earphones it's great with Dolby atmos.",1
I bought new phone  Samsung M20 in last 15 days ago. I got problem touch is very poor and hanging issues  as well. I am very sad with this phone Samsung M20.  Please i am requesting do not go in Samsung. Hanging is major issue always with Samsung phone.,1
"So I bought this one and returned it another day! Reason was a very simple one... Camera was not at all clear and it had a fault that my fingerprint scanner was loose and was moving in and out on pressing.
So just got it exchanged!

Battery life was good enough
Camera -(1/5)
Fingerprint - Maybe good one but mines was just a faulty piece.",3
"samsung could not change what they expected to change , the 5000 mah battery is a nominal battery  and its down in 1 night only ,however application stop automatically when we work on ,no change in sound quality, trying to make a  customizer for low - on -selling and cut-off  of amazon pay limited time ,  🤬🤬🤬🤬",1
"It was working well for first five months.Recently started a new issue was unable to answer calls at first incidence as touch was not responding few times.
Also today it was  a new incident where my mobile has fallen from my hands accidentally.Tempered glass was safe as it has no damage but screen has damaged.",2
Camera quality is quite bad actually and found that camera angle is not direct and weirdly focused. Screen and color reproduction is fair. Battery life is very good. Touch response deteriorate over last six months. Phone is bulky and heavy. Call quality and reception is not that good. Overall just okay deal.,3
"Biggest problem I've faced is, while mobile network is full and my cell phone is ON, I've got feedback from my callers that calls not getting connected. And this issue is being getting repeated several times. I've checked it with both sim cards. So there is no issue with mobile network operators. And the next issue is battery draining out fast and charging time also getting longer day by day. But still I've ordered same product for my teen son.",3
"I like battery of this phone but it's processor is not good  you can't play games like pubg you can set HD graphics but you can't play even in smooth settings, and in low light camera is not good ,and also I don't like it's screen touch after some time you feel like water in screen after putting temper guard its my personal opinion for screen and you can't use phone without guard because they don't give any protection in screen .In this phone we can't lock apps without download external apps it's irritating and also they don't give privacy space and it's finger print sensor is too bad overall not bad in normal use",2
"Samsung need to improve its quality inspection especially on the cosmetic part. There was glue on the right side of the screen, through the whole length. To avoid hassle of returning and since I will have to travel on Sunday. I thought I will keep the phone and tried removing the glue residue by myself but still the glue is not completely removed however it's not much visible now. Since I'm from manufacturing background this is totally unacceptable from a reputed brand like Samsung. Especially when you are trying to regain the market in this segment through your galaxy m series. So far didn't find any other issues with it. I just received the same today morning.",2
"tis product was slow charging batary pack up is only 20 hours camara is not clearity
complitly product was fail unconfertable
used 5 min cl very hot nt a battery quality feacher is fake picture quality is nt clearity all of fake feacher",1
"Samsung may give 4GB or 6GB or 1TB RAM but there is always going to be a performance issue. Phone hangs with simple operations.

Samsung official service center does not have parts to replace. I am pursuing the service center for replacement of damaed M20 screen for about a month now. Still the center don't have received the parts. Worst service ever.",1
"Bit disaapointed by this purchase. Primarily due to below reasons
1.Screen is uneccessarily smooth that makes typing extremely difficult. My advice would be try it atleast once before buying.
2. There is no LED notification light. So you have to keep opening the phone to check for any missed calls or messages.
3. Further decreasing the rating to 1 star after 2 weeks of use. Battery takes way too much time to charge up.  Many of the apps wont open by clicking once.",1
The overall product is very good but there is no app lock and data speed indicator. After 2 or 3 months  the bettry life will starts to verydecrease slightly. Sometimes it's  get heated when u play heavy games.the camera quality is very good and the fingerprint quality is also satisfied but the face unlock is slow and sometime the face detection doesn't  work.there is c type charger with 5000 battery.it almost takes 2 hour and 15 min to complete  full charge from 0 %.the battery life  is very impressive it gives a very nice battery  backup. If you are a normal regular user then it will not disappoint you.,3
Not a good phone regretting for purchasing this phone. This  model cannot be exchange to buy a new phone. Also the phone gets heated too fast and often. Also there is network issue and call drop problem with this phone model. Sound quality also very bad. I have a habit of keeping chocolate in my bag from when I have started using this phone the chocolate in my bag started melting so you can see the effect of how much this phone gets heated never experienced this problem with the other phone models which I have used previously.  A waste of money to buy this phone.,1
"Battery life, Performance and selfie camera are up to mark.  But don't have notification light. I mean how do we know that if get any message, call, if we keep in silent mood. Biggest draw back without notification light is charging status. You will not get to know whether phone is charging or not. If suddenly disconnected charging and you don't realize, no way you can trace it. This should be implemented. There are other brand products even with cheapest price, having this option. . Not sure what made Samsung to disable this. Otherwise I would have give 4 star.",3
"After 5 months of use
Pros - good screen and good camera
Cons- internet speed sucks (compared with mi note 4 same location same operator m20 struggles to download a 2mb video while note 4 does it in 20sec both using jionet and keeping besides)
It hangs to much even my more then half of storage is blank
Since last few days a new prob started while receiving call whn u swipe green button the call is terminated

Now even the phone lost its fast charging capacity

Better don't buy this phone",2
Bakwasss,1
"Samsung galaxy m20 is one of the average phone launched by Samsung in a range of Rs.9999. It offers us a wide range of features whether it is about battery life, fingerprint sensor or daylight picture quality. But it lacks mainly in features like slow motion vedio recording , night camera quality or in the box content. After all it is sum up of all features which is offered by other brands in higher prices. The feature I like the most is battery life, no heating issue and the dislike was a gaming performance, if you are an normal day to day user , then it is one of the best phones in this price range.",3
It's not been one month. I purchased it on 19th February.  Yesterday while getting the mobile charged it show that moisture has been detected in your charger/USB port. What the hell! It's so sophisticated then why Samsung even made it. It's gets hang very often. Worst product ever purchased from Amazon.,2
Waste of money Don't buy... It heats up during video recording and recording stops automatically and no apps will work then. We have to switch it off and switch on after some time to make the mobile work. Auto brightness doesn't work and we have to struggle to read in sunny outdoors.I purchased it for 12000/ and disposed it at 8000/.,1
Hangs too much... and came with touch faults...camera v poor...,2
"there are appreciable options in camera like wide angle mode, full screen camera but picture quality is poor and it doesn't make sense having prior features. phone responds slowly when you unlock the phone. gets over heated with gaming. I know all this before buying this phone but I had no option at that time I was in urge of buying so I ended up with this. now we might have other options under 12000 range. battery backup is extraordinary. lasts for 2 days with quite heavy usage. build quality is ok and it really doesn't matter to me because I never use any phone without back case. simply put camera and heavy gaming is your main criteria then a big no for this.",3
"It is good phone...everything is good with this mobile...but 2 problems are their:-
1) camera:- camera works really good in day time..and in sunlight...but at night it becomes worst..and front camera is not so good at night and day both...
2) charging problem:- after 2 weeks of purchasing this phone..it took like 5 hours to get fully charge..and sometimes only 2 hours....i suffer 2 months with this problem...and go to mobile service centre..they said go to samsung centre they will replace ur phone..but after a week of that..an update came into my phone..and now it's properly charging...",3
"Samsung gives best price for this product with the advantage of battery life, camera is not having good clarity, touch screen sensitivity is poor and hangs sometimes as most Samsung mobiles do, fingerprint reader is difficult to identify without visual..",3
"Brought the phone last week and started facing network issues within 3-4 days. The phone shows full network but the mobile data does not work sometimes, so i have to turn off the mobile data and turn it on again for it to work. Called amazon customer service and at first they were not willing to beleive that i am facing this issue and after a 40 minutes call they assigned a technician. Today the technician came and he did not face the network issue az he used the phone just for 5 minutes. As i only face this issue sometimes while using the phone and i already clearly mentioned this to the amazon customer service and the technician, amazon is not willing to replace the device.",1
"few things disappointed me
Very Imp - when you report your problem to Amazon, they just provide false commitment and silly promise.
My phon is defective, i want a replacement or refund. I tried calling several times to Amazon and Samsung but only i have "" we are looking into this, your are a valuable customer""

Don't ever buy from Amazon

1 Extra noise during call, which cause headache
2 Not good camera
3 Fingerprint reader should vibrate during attempt
4 battery is not working well according to 5000 mah battery",1
"I just hate this product. The camera quality is simply pathetic and the other issues include excessive heating of device during charging and continuous screen hanging issue.
The front as well as back camera clicks all blur pictures in normal mode.  I want to return this product at the earliest, but Amazon is not accepting the return of this product even within the first 10Days of order placement.
Never buy this phone.
#Pathetic #customerservice",1
"Buy only if you want long battery life. Processor is slow. Camera quality is very poor. Finger print sensor is slow and location is not properly reachable. Also the screen is TFT and not even LCD which is the worst when using it from a brand like samsung. Wanted to return the phone on the 3rd day of use. Cant expect this from samsung. Mi 6, Mi Note 6 pro is far much better in camera quality, finger print sensor and battery life with same price range.

Camera quality - 4/10
Battery - 9/10
Finger print sensor - 5/10
Screen - 4/10",1
"please do not purchase samsung m20 as the battery life is too less even though it is mentioned 5000 mah , please dont purchase for sake of 5000 mah and the display is extremely poor, i will say i have redmi note 3 and its been 2 years and the display of redmi note 3 is better than samsung m20 , i asked for refudn and even though they are not initaiting the refund , please please dont purchase samsung",1
"We purchased M20 on 11th April and found there is a defect in My mobile, where the voice of the MIC is not audible for Incoming and Out going calls.  we have checked with Service Center : 0008301163 and service center person told that the MIC sound will be the low when compare with any other mobiles.
Model Number: Model name : SM-M205FZBGINS , Serial Number: RZ8M305V4JP(354554103943930) .
I am not happy with the Product and the way responded in the service center.

Please let me know who can support for this issue....... My mobile number: 9940652928.

"I got this phone today itself.. I was pretty excited about it.. however now I am disappointed.. because once I start the phone and update all my apps it started heating up frm back, now I am not sure whether to use this phone or not.. and the selfie camera is a waste.. even it is not important for me..
Now the phone is so hot I can literally iron cloth with it.. not expected this from Samsung.. :(
Now it started to hang as well often..
So my suggestion would be not to buy this phone..",1
"It's alright for the price range however the phone hangs a lot even during the first few days. Touch sensitivity needs to be improved. Processor falls slow when multiple applications are running. Brightness is also a bit problematic.

Battery seems to be good. However phone overheats quickly. Too many useless Samsung apps preinstalled without options of uninstalling.",2
"I purchased the samsung M20 June 2019.Since the purchase the mobile many problems.
1.Sometimes camera not working,once restart the mobile then working properly.
2.During Incoming and Outgoing call sound only came ,after 10 sec display shows the contact number.
3.Most of the times mobile Slow,even i am not installled many application and games.
4.While incoming call the green button not working.once power button off and on then only the green button working.
5.While using any app,back button press,after 10 sec only the app went back.
That much slow the mobile.",1
"Seriously guys... It's a request... please don't buy this m 20. Camera is too bad.  PUBG lags in this phone. Game play is very slow. Samsung UI is worst. Display is not good. Operating systems verybad.
But battery is excellent. Go for another handsets.
AGAIN plz don't buy this phone.",1
It's the worst phone ever seen. Hangs a lot. When I type anything to send msg it does 10 things at a time in a screen and then stop. For everything it hangs. Worst part is no return and replacement to other model. Amazon told me technician will come n check if its really hanging issue then they will replace with same phone. I don't know when will this be replaced. I lost faith in this mobile. Now while typing this msg also its getting hanged.,1
"Charging is pathetic. It takes full night to get it charged to 40%.
Don't receive VOLTE properly. Signal strength is one or two bars only. One has to switch to 3G for full signal strength.
Service is worst. Service center said changed motherboard. It was only ten days when I bought this phone.
Camera is average that was the only thing for which I bought this phone. But it didn't meet expectations.",1
"Totally waist of money worst smartphone from samsung...
It starts hangs after 5th day of purchase... Im very much dissappointed with this product samsumg service sentre also deny to replace this... Worst worts phone",1
 being lover of samsung brand...i had never expected this worst series  m20...bought it in first sale..i found it hanging from first day....unable to play pubg due to hanging problem.Its touch working after clicking power button off..bad nd pathetic  series..talked to samsung care 10 times they are totally helpless.Dont buy it...,1
"My phone is only 10 days old and it hangs a lot. Touch doesn't work properly. Many a time, when I call someone or receive a call, the disconnect button and call receive button doesn't work. Didn't like the phone. Unhappy with the purchase. Cannot even return since the return window is closed. Really disappointed.",1
"Please don't buy this product, I purchased this for my wife, starting it was good running fast. After 6 months it's becoming slow. Now to open a lock screen it's taking 10sec, for unlocking it's taking 10 seconds, to open call app it taking 10 seconds.

To say if you want to make call when the phone is locked it will take 30 second to do that. While making call also you can hear the ring but you can't see the display if you want to turn on loud speaker you need to wait for another 10 seconds,

I won't recommend any Samsung phones. It's better to avoid those phones",1
"The phone performance is great but the reason i gave it 1 star is because the phone has a heating problem. My phone would work perfectly when im in a cold place but when ever im out in the sun or even in the car the phone heats up badly. Hen i figured out this problem, i contacted the customer care and went to the nearest samsung repair centre, at the centre they asked me to change the battery and i was asked to pay for that when my phone was in perfect condition less than 1 months old. It didnt seem ethical to me so i thought of not using the device. Samsung please solve my problem.",1
"Writing this review after one month of use.
This phone is very slow. I'm using normal daily basis apps not any heavy usage but still this phone is very slow. Don't go for this phone. This phone lacks speed & display contrast of this phone is not good. so don't go for this phone & don't purchase it.",1
"In the product i got delivered , there is a problem in display n touch its not working properly same way itz got stuck while using n having an incoming calls...!! I have requsted for Refund bt they have said that only they can replace another.
FIRST IMPRESSION IS ""WORST"" IMPRESSION",1
"Charging time is very high. Touch response is very slow.
Battery quick descharge. Finger print Denver is slow. Very poor quality phone. There is many better options in the less than 1000 WIFI CONNECTION SEARCHING IS TAKE BIG TIME. When charging the phone it very  hot and phone does not work for 10 to 15 minutes",1
"Samsung M20 4x64GB is bit slower than 3GB Ram Lenovo. M20 sim tray isn't quality checked I guess it has scratches dents on. I had tough times to set the sims and memory card on and insert it to phone.  Overall it's not a very good phone.  Cheap quality for the money we spent.
Charger cable is short and weak. The ends of cable would not last for 6 months.
Amazon cheated me with high price without return policy.",1
"this phone is just a piece of junk i can say, 3 days up now and phone gets hanged,need to restart erverytime, internet doest work properly, 5000mAh is just for name sake, battery gets drained off by 7 hours without using media, excellent fast charge 3X(TAKES 3.17MINS TO FULL CHARGE) wherein other phones does its job in 1.52mins MAX.
Customers please check 10 times before buying this junk.
I just wasted my time waiting for flash sale",1
Pathetic services from amazone phone fingerprint not working properly in new phone from day one and coustmer care is asking to do many thing like u have to follow software updating then we will check through blanco app then we will give you return services.as a coustmer why I do and now I'm paying for defective item my money. And the coustmer  care service agents are so unprofessional  and rude. Now onward I will not buy anything from Amazon. Flipkart services are far better then you. Learn something from them.,1
"I want to return this phone as it's not working properly, Team please help me out to return this phone to seller.

As facing call receiving, call hangup and after some times 30 to 40 seconds phone going in silent mode and then call getting disconnected

Please suggest the way forward to return this phone or replace with some other product.",1
"This phone doesn't have a good processor u cant use more apps the phone always get stuck and if u r a gamer please avoid this phone.

The cam is just ok finger print also a draw back in this phone.

Touch pad was worst some times after 50 percent charging the touch pad will not work u need to restart then it will work. As all the Samsung phones stuck it is also same and more than other series.

The only good thing is battery. Just in 2 months the price dropped to 9999 only I'm really disappointed.
😔

Please dont go for this phone.",2
"I bought this product in feb. I am so fed up that i hink pf going back to uaong my MI Redmi 6. The touch hangs so much rendering the phone useless. I constantly have to lock it using the powerkey and then unlock using the finger scanner. Then only woyld it regain toch senstivity.

I dont sugeest anyone to waste money on this good for nothing phone.",1
"The phone is very much stylish, sleek and looks elegant. However, performance wise, it has some issues like it doesn't always support 2 VOLTE networks simultaneously. Moreover, the touch response is erratic at times. The erratic behaviour is more pronounced near the edges thus making it difficult to operate single handedly and quite often, a lag is experienced especially while typing. Camera is clear and sharp and does the job. Battery life is outstanding.",3
The purpose  of mobile not find in this phone. The voice quality in call  find very very bad. Which is not expected. Mobile is for calling but here in this phone u do everything  except calling. I also examine the network but I found network  is good but problem with phone.,3
"Galaxy M20 is the best in the smartphone! don't hesitate to go for it! It's really a Cool one and really amazes you and 100% satisfies you.
It had so many unique features and Design was ultimately awesome! Don't listen to the negative reviews pls! And i forget to tell you that this one  really a Worth for money product",1
"Pros:
Exellent Face recognistion
Finger Print sensors are good
Best looks, design
Sleek and stylish
Canera is good

Cons:
Heats up like anything when 4 or more task run simultaneously
Battery backup is not upto the mark
Display hangs, doesn't  function at many instances
Little large to use with one hand

I don't  recommend this phone. Cheap and low stabdard product from Samsung",1
"I am mi user earlier. Phone looks wise very good but its getting hung while opening. And speed is bit less compared to mi. Apps getting crashed. Not worth to buy and no value for money. They have give samsung Exynos processor. I feel Snapdragon processor is much more better than this one. And coming to games.... No way. 1 hour playing of any game, phone getting heat. Camera lovers... There is no slow motion video in this. No head phones. Cannot switch multiple apps very fastly.

Good thing is infinity screen,
 Sound quality is good. My recommendation not to buy.",2
"I bought this phone on the very first sale.
Inital experience was very nice. But to my horror when I charged the phone it doesn't charge.
The charger was fine, there might be some issue in hardware. And after a while phone got switched off.
Although Amazon returned my product and refunded money in 3 days, i am unable to delete my data from phone as it was off.
Very very worst experience of Samsung.
I suggest never buy Samsung,
I had purchased Note 6 Pro at the same price, and believe me its working fine.

** The service of Amazon was good from shipping to refunding but this M 20 S****",1
"The mobile is OK on looks. I have noticed 2 major issues

1). Touch is not working properly, Not at all  smooth experience
2). Phone is getting over heating on 10mints camera usage (on Video Recording)

I had a very bad experience earlier with Samsung S7 edge, now againt i got into this brand trap...",3
"Well, phone is good, but the display started showing vertical lines exactly on 20th day of purchase, Samsung has 15days replacement warranty, missed it by 5 days. Had to spend half a day in samsung service center to get the display changed free of cost. My assumption that buying a reputed brand will not have any issues, but I was proven wrong. All electronic items are the same, cant trust them.",2
"I got M 20 and M30 both but honestly not happy with processors coz it started hanging M30 in 2 months and M20 within 6 month and when sometime you put your  finger on finger touch  do not unlock at at a go . You have to try twice a d thrice and camera is poor than the other ones in this price range , Samsung just worked on battery which  is only thing that are giving against our investment",3
"Very very worst service from amazon. Forcing me to use the deffected product. Every one other than amazon can see the white bright spot on the screen, in the photo uploaded(see the deffect in the photo on the end of word ""messages"" ).I realised the deffect immediately after the purchase, but they don't want to replace the product. I contacted their custpmer care, uploaded the photos, but neither their executive nor their system couldn't recognise the deffect.they gie me oe service centre link. Bu it s also not respoding.. Better to go flipkart for onine puchase.",1
"Poor quality display , just in 12 days various issues started in the phone, we called amazon but they told after 10 days we can't replace / return the phone so they told us to go to samsung care center , after reaching there they told us that the phone is having physical damage  inspire of the fact that the screen was ok and screen protection glass was in good condition, after all they charged us 4500₹ for the screen replacement......poor response from Samsung helpline mentioning that we overpressed the phone screen, just negligence from Samsung and amazon team.....",1
"After 5 months of using this phone, phone hung issue and touch issue seen in higher rate. Moreover I am having only basic apps installed, still the issue is seen.

To temporarily recover from this issue, need to rest app performance atleast once in every 3 days and clean the memory every day.

Worst phone.. I promise that u will look for
replacing the phone after 4-6 months of usage.",1
"Lot of software issues.
Battery problems.
Phone is already dead just in 4months of minimal usage.

Note : Only 3 apps were used WhatsApp, Voot and MxPlayer.

Google Play Services don't work properly on this device.
Play store doesn't work.

Actually many of the apps crash due to unstable Google Play Services.

Battery drains out quickly.

Camera is just average.",1
"Seems Good but Heavy. Haven't used it fully or tried all the functions and its capabilities.
Bought it for my mom. Had to put a screen guard and back cover for protection. After this, using it often seems like doing exercise and the wrists dont like the weight unless kept on a surface.
The Display looks very good as is the battery. The startup screen of Samsung is exciting due to the stories it pulls up out of web.
It's definitely better in many ways than the Jseries except its weight and thinness.",3
One of the worst product from Samsung. Very slow operating product.performance of connecting internet is not at level.i suggest people don't go for this product ..it doesn't met the expectations as it has 4gb ram in built.perfomrs not even at level.touch is very bad ..only Camara you can expect some good clicks at daylight..become very slow now and irritates alot as some time net connectivity goes off itself ..I dont know which technology has been used by brand samsung..totally utter waste of investment on this cell phone.,1
"Totally worst product from Samsung M20 i dis-agree from this type of rejected product supplied by amazon and product of brand called Samsung, from day one we are facing charging issues in phone hence we had changed adapter with data cable need help for this product if the trusted brand Samsung will do like this type of customer unsatisfactory work how we can trust for newest product in future. Hope in future this will not repeat & will get technical support with free of cost from technical department.
Thanks for your great support Amazon & Samsung",1
"This is not worth to buy
Don't spend your money to bye this one
 - Camera quality is horrible
 - Face lock is not working as expected
 - A dailer function is also not proper
 - Handset weight is also little more than other
 - Gallery function also not sorted/configured properly
 - Default theme app icon also like childish
Only plus point is Battery back up - But not like it will run for a week without charging :D

I don't recommend this mobile",2
"Hi every one after I am using this mobile after one month I am very shock for many issu I am facing face unlock and fingerprint u look so slove not working properly mobile also not not good mobile speed very poor and slov every my reqwest to you please dont west your many and dont buy this mobile
Please don't buy
Very poor built quality.
I tried to return mobile handset but unfortunately there is no return policy. You can only replace this.
Very disappointed with Mobile Samsung M20.
Many better options available with less price.",1
"It's been a week I'm using M20, not at all gud. Hangs every time. Ringtone doesn't working. Screen goes black all of sudden and after which nothing works and No option to power off or restart.
Data cable quality is worst. Adapter is gud. Charging also it takes 3 to 4 hrs for ful charging. Wats the use of going 15w adapter than? Over all my suggestion is to think once again before you buy.

Camera clarity is awesome. Screen resolution is very gud. Since I'm facing other issue mentioned above I'm not happy with the product. This is my review on the product I received last Friday.",1
"Looks premium, awesome design, but I am badly missing 'double-tap screen on' feature and the notification LED. Processor is reasonably fast, no lag and heating issues by far. Big battery (lasts 1.5 days with moderate use), Dolby sound and dragontrail glass make it a good product to go for. Camera picture quality is okay type, not great.

I found it quite slow after 1 month use. I also use redmi note 4 and redmi mobiles with snapdragon anyday the best mobiles to buy. So, don't think it can beat Redmi note series or other mobiles with Snapdragon processor.",2
"The live focus mode in this phone is very very bad.only 1times out of 100 it will correctly detect your edges.the second bad thing on this phone is on which it was advertised,'Battery'The battery performance is poor according to its battery capacity.it never give me more than 1.5days along on average uses.but the charging is fast enough.The 3rd bad thing is its face unlock.it will unlock your phone even with your picture.The most horrible thing which make this phone a garbage is its network frequency.phone hamesa emergency call pe chala jata h aur speed bilkul bhi nhi ata h even in good network area",3
Don't buy this go for redmi note 7/7pro to much software limitations not even updated android pie. light sensor not working properly.(no light sensor use front camera as virtual light sensor)too much lag in normal apps like youtube & twitter. only reason to buy this phone is if u don't trust china brand phone,3
"Unfortunately I had to buy M20 as I was in rush and my S7 edge was broken.  There were no earfones, the touch does not work many a times which irritates and I never faced this prb with my S7 edge. The camera is not that great..just ok. If I am playing a video or listening to a song and during that if somebody calls me, the video wont stop which is quite surprising. The keypad also stucks while typing. Anyways I should not expect or compare it with my old one , as it is not that expensive.",3
"I used a Redmi 4 before this and I must say, the fingerprint scanner is a tortoise (yes, this one loses when compared with Mi, and I am not an Mi Fan at all). Overall UI transition is too slow, you can feel the lag in everything you do with this phone.
Camera and screen are just fabulous!! Also, the battery is just amazing.
Just wish they'd have used a good processor, that would make the overall experience a 5 star.

All in all, not bad for the price range, if you disregard app launching performance. Once launched, apps work at normal speeds.",3
"this phone only two very good things
1st battery is good
2nd display for streaming online videos
and all other specs is very bad i didn't recommend this phone who use lots of messages and notification or gaming
this phone only for watching movies and web series because it have widevine l1 support.
this phones display open slow, when calls come phone will ring and vibrate but display will open after 1 or 2 second. fingerprint is super slow, wake up time when power button press is super slow,so please guys don't buy this phone.",1
"This is the worst ever mobile I purchased . Don’t buy and amazon after sell support is pathetic.

1. Heating issues- mobile is getting heated more than 44degree celsius.
2. Getting hanged multiple times
3. Issues with brightness
4. Video lag is happening and its not because of buffering. This is because of some hardware issues.

I tried reaching the customer support and they tried with some diagnostic which is pathetic and not giving any solution. I am still struggling with them to either get it fixed or replaced.",1
"I m writing this review after using one month.Its 4GB/64 GB variant.
1)Phone started getting  hang within one month still 2GB RAM& 45 GB memory is free, even I have not yet installed any heavy applications.Cant understand why!
2)Samsung is also not providing any support  just saying it reset it your problem will be solved.
2)Over all design and battery is good.
3)Camera is just OK.
I can conclude that Samsung has not yet overcome about their hanging issue in phones,even after such a good specification.I want refund If they can.",1
"im using m20 in last 2 days, as per my experience , little bit hang problem during playing PUBG, and 3rd party browser open krne pe bi, even sab update kar liya. lekin stil chipak rha hai little bit kabhi kabhi. and talking about design and grip best feel like a brand .. but disappointed with hang problem. starting me ye hai to after 6 month aap smjh skte ho.",3
"I can give overall 3.5 star for this.
Internet connectivity is slow when compared to mi mobile, checked with same sim in both the devices.
Front camera is not that good considering 8 mp produces too much smooth artificial images of faces for selfies. Back camera is good enough.
Battery backup and charging is the most plus point and best point of the phone.
Device should have been more thinner and lighter would be great.",3
"Picture quality  is as the same as previous samsung mobiles in this range. No special improvement.

Sound quality  is improved and i quite impressed.

Battery life is not as i expected, i thought it will last minimum  for 2 days but its last for 1.5days maximum.

The major issue is battery heats up while playing games. Within 20 mins of continuous gaming,the upper  portion of the mobile heats up.

This issue has to be resolved as i prefer Samsung  mobiles for long term use,but if the heating issue continues then i have to switch  it within 6 months",3
"its legging issue, after few days use antutu score 25k decrease bcoj beg issue in fon, processor is not 7904, its 7885",1
"After using it from last 4 months finally I am writing this review.
Pros:
》Budget phone
》Good battery backup.
Cons:
》Lots of Samsung bloatware apps
》Fingerprint sensors is not that fast.
》Camera quality is average
》Sometimes keyboard hangs
》Sometimes if backkey is press it erases all text.",3
"Camera is very good and the best part is battery life it just goes on.
Cons are :
1) poor touch screen scensor  , very bad scrolling
2) too heavy
3) does not come with gorilla glass
4) Designing part needs improvement.",3
"The Samsung M20 failed to charge as per the said time. Despite its boastful claim of 5000mah battery, the 15W fast charger took 4 hours and 12 minutes to charge the first time from 0% to 100%.

I did a hard reset and drained my battery entirely. In my second charge, the phone took 2 hours to only charge 26%.

I have posted a photo of it but I’m not able to upload two photos to show the stopwatch I had running to prove my claim.",2
"Nothing Special,
Only Highlight is 5000Mah Battery, But it Drains Quickly.
Camera is Below Average,
Sound is Very Low :(
Processor is Worst 😡
Mobile Hangs So Much is Normal Usage.

Don't Buy M20 💔
Waste Of Money",1
"Overall operation sucks, hangs every now n then. Very slow fingerprint senser response. Camera is great in this range (only plus point along with 'C type charger' and battery point) but overall the phone is not worth it.

Worse part is that it does not show up the exchange list neither here nor on flipkart that you can replace it for other mobiles. I really regret spending 13k on this.

Total rating would be 2/5 👎",1
"The phone looks super. Camera and battery life is superb. But fast charging is not at all fast, just regular. So many ads popping up again and again, makes it irritating. Mind you, its not that ads are coming when we run an app, but when we unlock the phone, every single time. I don't  know how to make the ads go away. Also 4G is too slow, like gprs or edge. Only 3G speed is possible.",3
"Product is not at all good, camera clarity bad doesn't gives the output of 13mp camera also.
5000mah battery takes full night charging and charges Only 90%. Full charge comes for one day with no Pubg and videos.
Very poor with network. Jio and airtel that works on another mobile at same location doesn't show network in this mobile even after changing network settings. No support from Amazon and now I can't even sell this product for half price.",1
"Bought on 12th June. Not even two months of usage-and the board has gone kaput. Doesn't switch on. Doesn't charge. Bought it for my parents.

Took it to the service centre they repaired it. Said problem was with the board.

Again 1.5 months later. Same issue. Switched off. Not charging. Not working. This time the service center has replaced the board.

4 months 2 repairs. Let's see what happens next.

Didn't expect this from Samsung at all.",1
"It's a stylish phone which nice display which is bright and premium looking but the camera quality is very poor, the selfie cam is not that good but its average yeah but the rear camera is not goods, the camera is a disappointment.
If camera is not your priority then go for it otherwise this phone is not for you.",3
"Pros: Display is superb, clear pixel and batter backup is OK
Cons:
-Phone always hangs, mandatory need to reboot every day otherwise you can't use the phone at all.
-Camera is worst than 8MP i didn't expect this from Samsung.
-Touch didn't work then need to lock the phone and unlock to make working. it occurred very often, workaround reboot everyday.
-Touch sensitivity is very bad
- 2.8GB RAM used by Android and samsung UI, only 1GB is provided to user purpose that why phone hangs and not responding touch",2
with a new series I thought that samsung will increase there quality. But still samsung smartphones are same as old smartphones. My samsung M20 start hanging just after inserting sim cards. it hangs every time in normal uses like after watching youtube the disply does not respond even after having 4GB of RAM. So advice to everybody  don't purchase.,1
"Don't buy this phone. One of the worst phone. My sis asked some phone to buy. I suggested this phone beavuse of Samsung name. That's why I didn't suggest other phones. But I ditched her hard earned money. Worst battery, heavy, touch response is not good, camera is worst.",1
"It's great phone value for Money.
After one month ussage auto brightness not working properly ( night time).
When I bought this phone it's heating issues as march and April month high temperature.
May 30 Samsung released new Android Pie version after updated phone the phone working very well.
1) Automatic brightness working perfectly
2) No heating issues for 100 digress farrenheat
3) Phone performance is good",3
"'Quite disappointment' is what may be summed up regarding the performance of the product. Just couple of days after using the handset, there's an acute issue of plugging the charger with the handset. All the time of connecting the charger with handset, it says , "" Moisture has been detected. Unplug the charger and wait until both the charger and USB port are dry"".

Now obviously, the charging of the battery is almost used up leaving the handset to be a mere object-of-no-use.",2
"This mobile M20  will frequency hang it it takes several minutes to recover, also sometimes it will call anybody automatically without your wish eventually you will get embarrassed. and hell lot of pop up ads will appear when you unlock your screen. It's so irritating that in emergency call and ads appear and you need to close the ads before making emergency call, you will feel like smashing it on the floor. Battery life is awesome in 1st month only",1
"I was a tad disappointed. That could have been because, with all the hype surrounding the M20, I was expecting a lot more from it than I got. I've got the Samsung Galaxy S8 as well so the quality of the M20 doesn't come anywhere close to the S8.
The M20 isn't a bad phone. In fact, I think it's a good phone. It just isn't a GREAT phone.",3
"This was the worst phone which I never seen  in my life, why I was telling like that means I presented it to my wife as gift but my daughter without knowing thrown in water but with in seconds I take that phone went to service centre they told after one day like motherboard was not working and tpu need to change overall it will cost around 7000 technology improving a lot but we are not getting water proof relevant in phone I bought a month back useless for me, Mi brand is providing better that this",2
"I bought the phone on 8th Feb and have been facing a lot of difficulties. The screen gets frozen in every 30 secs and the back button works only after 5-10 secs of freeze. There are random phone calls being made from the phone, It even feeds numbers in the web page or app without any input. Please dont buy this phone.",1
I really regret for buying this product.  I did not expect this from Samsung. Screen freezes when I receive a call and Touch does not work. so I cant attend the call.  It happens 80% of the times and  I can't say how much it annoys me. Finger print  scanner takes 5 seconds some times and 2 seconds on average.,1
"Don't waste money in purchase of this product ....I purchased this phone in April 2019...I am facing a big network issue with this phone...i use idea sim that too single sim since buying, not receving proper signal strength to receive data fast....every time YouTube videos will buffer in this phone even sigal and data is available in phone..... It's of waste when your phone doesn't give good internet experience.....

WASTE OF MONEY......",1
"Poor battery ....spoke to Amazon technical support Mr Nutan ( supervisor) ..total ludacris solution...the technician is asking me to turn off GPS and  INTERNET to check battery life . Why on earth a person would buy a smart phone if you do not want to use these two important features...rather buy a phone for just Rs 1500 ..the new phone battery being a 5000 MaH is only 6hrs...as per the tech support it should give 28 hrs "" as per lab conditions"" felt like laughing...there is no logic in solution.",1
"There some problems in this mobile -

1- Battery backup is not like 5000mah. It's new today but when be old then how it will perform?
2- it's new but always ask to update software. Why it's.
3- Camera quality is not as expected.",2
"Please don't  buy this phone.
Reasons.
1. Very poor fingerprint sensor.
2. Very poor  signal connection.
3. No Voice in calls sometimes. This  is a lag in phone not network.
4. Very slow processor for PuBG like games.
5. Battery is fine.
6. Very low camera quality  not what Samsung  is famous for.
7. Face recognition is also not fast.
8. Build  Quality  is very very poor. Without  Temper  and Cover phone is like a piece  of low quality  plastic  toy.",1
Battery is decent otherwise nothing works properly fingerprint lacks camera is like 3.2MP no low light photo can be taken accept battery phone is below average seriously I bought just because of Samsung branding currenty using iPhone so that’s why I think I didn’t like the camera and sensor but of u are on low budget go for it but it’s better to add some more money and go for upper version of smart phones,3
"VoLTE working for both the SIM Slot Vodafone +Jio tried successfully. The Device will work with all the LTE Service providers.Battery back up is  good but it is not high speed Turbo charging. Overoll system performance is ok.The RF Performace is not good (Mainly due to the Exinos processor instead of Qualcome) at the low coverage areas,call is getting interrupted at cell edge.Medium budget users can opt this phone",3
One of the Worst phone it takes 12 hours to charge phone and it says Fast charging when contacted customer care I need to contact Samsung customer service after taking phone to service centre also still same issue. So Please don't buy this M20 mostly fake paid review better go for some other brand phone.,1
"So I am editing my earlier review, after using this phone for over 6 months now I can safely say it's one of the worst phones I have ever used in this price range. The phone regularly hangs up and the only solution is to lock and then unlock it. The problem has been very frequent of late. I don't the reason but the customer service has been very poor. The recent update might be a reason for it or the 'sasta' in-house processor that Samsung has used for the phone. I don't know exactly but the overall experience has been very poor.",1
"Ths device is not upto marked as expected. Long time taking to recharge the battery,  over heating, internet access very slow, most of the time in disconnect status, and many problem facing.",2
"Phone has big problem of network,  while with same sim and network working absolutely fine in other phone but in M20 it has signal issue. I have tried with Airtel & Jio both. First time i thought this would be issue with one of the phone Amazon exchanged my phone with new device but same problem exists. Also google backup can't download in this phone. Battery is good but phone also has a heating issue. No earphone with. Camera is good. Just affordable nothing amazing.",3
"Bought - 21st feb, M series sale
Today - 17th may
Honest review after 2 months 24 days👌
Best part - 1. Performance 👍use multiple apps at the same time
2. Display (bright) amazing experience watching videos
3.Design - feels light(even on 5000mah battery)
4.finger print - smooth👌

Low points - 1. Battery 100%charge(  1 day 5 hours)😥
2. Camera - below average 🙁
3. Waiting for android 9 update",3
This mobile not satisfied and bad performance hanking problem and camera bad quality. Not fast changing  so I request all people  not purchase this mobile phone and and and Samsung companies vary bad and Froad,1
"If you buy Samsung M20 mobile then you will be cheated & mentally harrassed by Samsung because voice calling quality is too bad can't reach your sound to other person & can't hear also. Facing network issue every time.
Note: phone will only replace not refund.
So be careful",1
"Product delivered by Amazon, is defective product  , phone get heat while put on charging",1
"Samsung M20 is a substandard product very very poor quality. In 20 days the display malfunctioned. Samsung service centre at Dadar opined that it happened due to a fall. I insisted that the mobile never fell. They then said the LCD has cracked due to it being pressed. This is ridiculous. They quoted me ₹4750 for replacement and I've brought the phone is just 1 month back. The service manager flatly said to speak to call centre. Disappointed ... not expected such a service from Samsung.

My complaint no is 4283096822",1
"Product is good.
But still tere is problem with my mobile.
It's laggy, while using application gets stuck.
Headset speaker is very bad during call vibrating near fingerprint sensor.
Problem with the network 1-2 points on Jio and Airtel sim after sitting near to the window also. ( Problem faced by me ).

Battery life is good.
Rear camera is good, front camera is bad.
On screen and on back you can see fingerprint marks while usage.
During gameplay phone starts heating and lagging, fingers also while start sweating.",1
"This is my review after 1 month of using
Lots of ads.... it annoys very very much, even if u are calling someone or taking a picture; advertisement comes in between, its very irritating. I tried to block ads by many means but it is not possible to block them.
1) camera- is good in light but there is no slow motion feature.
2) battery- is good .
3)Processor- is slow, so slow operating.
4) sound- Low volume of speaker. need improvement..
5) fingerprint sensor and face detector is also slow",2
"Mobile is not up to the mark, compared to it's competitors, it has got very less performance in all categories. When it comes to camera's performance it fails drastically, both rear and front, images are captured with broken pixels and it adds some noise in the images which leads to unrealistic image. Battery life will not exceed a day even after less usage. Look wise mobile looks fabulous, even display and some other new features are good in this mobile. But as a over all package it lags way long behind it's contenders.",3
"Bought Samsung phone after a long long time had thought that samsung would have improved now looking at configurations of M20 but they have not learnt from the past mistake which resulted in market share loss to Redmi,Oppo,Vivo etc.
Only positive is battery life which lasts for a day after heavy use.
camera below average,screen hangs twice or thrice in a day which I am not accustomed to now a days.
Display is average.
Not buying samsung phone ever again in my life",2
"I am writing this review after my one week of usage.
1) Display resolution and color effect is very good as in other Samsung phone.
2) Finger print sensor is good and quick responsive.
3) Camera photo clarity is not up to the mark, specially when we start auto focus.
4) Battery performance is not good even if it is having 5000 mAh battery, It consume more with normal usage of whatsapp, Youtube etc.
5) Advertisement problem on lock screen, even if we keep OFF for all marketing information.",3
"When I heard it has a 5000mah battery,I felt happy and ordered immediately.Because of its battery number(5000mah) I compromised on rest of details I.e.,processor, camera,built quality and ect. But when I started using this phone I realized that all the pramoters of this phone fooled me. I'm a light user but it requires a charge again in between 9 hours. And also noice cancelation and speaker not up to mark. CHOICE IS YOURS.
☆☆ for battery,
☆☆ for built quality,
☆☆☆ for camera,
☆☆☆☆☆ for display",3
"The network coverage  quality is very poor
Jio sim network doesn't work properly in Samsung Galaxy m20
But Camera quality is awesome  phone look so sexy in blue color  battery backup was 100%better from all other  mobile
I'm just disappointed wit network  coverage
I use my jio sim in Nokia edition 1 the mobile  cost is only 4500 dat was working  excellent all time full network  but Samsung  Galaxy m20  Network  coverage  is very poor  ....
If U  ignore  this then everything is better then mi mobile  ...",3
"it automatically opens the applications... and when google is opened, it automatically does what it wants and search for something...
never experienced these kind of worst phone...
I never suggest to anybody to buy this phone.
please take back your phone and return my money",1
"the handset is not up-to the mark ,
my phone is simply troubling with the display  after a month of purchase unfortunately I couldn't replace my handset  Bcos it has a very minimum time of return policy ....
dissapointed with the product
definitely don't buy this Samsung M20",1
"Hello there, its been a month now I am using this phone and trust me its had been a real pain in the ass since I using this as an secondary phone than also its performance is so poor i am hardly using 4-5 apps which is installed apart from the default apps you get with this phone. The major problem is with voice everytime you are talking over the phone the voice keeps cracking even after formatting nothing has changed. Also it lags in and hangs if i am chatting over some app. This is really a pathetic device.",1
"Its brand new one day only, but heating heavily, don't buy this. message appears ""moisture deducted, wait for battery and charger dry"" & it is not charged. while contact customer they asked me to run balcano app & it is deduct previous logs.  luckley it deducts at 10th day and returned.  But customer care dot take serious about our problems, when i told first day itself they are not agreed to replace.  10 times i have called them and they want to divert us.  if the same phone does problem on 11th day then they wont replace.",1
Phone hangs a lot since starting..not good for long run not worth it...even thinking to sell now and have used it for just 11 months....internal memory is 32 gb however i dont know where does it takes all the cache and internal memory..though i have transferred all the data and apps to sd card...irritated with the phone,1
"Getting so much s/w issues. Even a call log numbers displaying getting overlapping.  Some time touch got not responding that time I have to lock the device and doing the unlock then it will work proper. Need to improve more in s/w side. Phone getting slow while opening the call log. If I am called some person call screen will comes after 4 seconds.

Single word there is too much s/w issues.  Samsung team will concentrate more in s/w line.  UI is good .
Battery is awesome.
Camera is good.",3
"Please don't buy this Samsung Galaxy m20.
I read a whole lot of negative reviews and yet decided to go for it because of its 5000 mah battery and the reason that I was buying it for my father, thinking their was not much expectations on its performance because he uses it solely for calls and WhatsApp and no other ram consuming activities, but the still the phone started to hang and user interface feels clumsy to use. Theres something seriously wrong with this models performance. Please don't go for it.",2
"Front camera is not good, battery full charge in 2.5hourse, face recognisation is not good, 3,32 mobile only 1gb ram is blank and 2gb ram is collected other internal apps by Samsung and pre installed app, rom is 21gb blank ,battery discharge in only 10 hours use, network range is also less,i didn't get handset with mobile phone  accessories as describe in description , it shows hanging poor camra quality in night and when mobile is sake thane clerity of mobile goes worse",1
"Bought this phone 2 weeks back,SAMSUNG M20 has a inherent problem...when switched on, the display takes its own sweet time to come on....so the time lag to get display is very annoying . contacted the samsung service centre and waiting for rectification..",1

Do not purchase this phone. Disappointed by SAMSUNG.,1
"Samsung Always Trusted Brand for Quality and Features. But Samsung M20 recent Launch Product is Absolutely Poor Software and Performance. Hanging Priblem, Pathetic for Attend Phone calls and Applications.Heating problems reduce Battery Life for not even single day usage which is Given 5000Mah.absoultely Poor Battery Back up.Software is  comparing  with Non Branding Products.Such a worst Software that disturb in Auto Changing applications, Hanging , Auto Typing and Auto Phone calls.",2
"Very very Third class phone, Its my first experience with samsung phone, With excitement i purchase M20 samsung phone  after use i realized draw back of phone, 1. Display average, 2. Battery not gud as 5000 mah 3. every time hanged phone without loadin on RAM, 4.

I thought Samsung came up with one UI with solved all the down side of their previous Touchwiz UI. But I was wrong... Now I just hate it.. 😠..battery performance  and backup is good... Still exynos  processor  is garbage.. Don't expect  any major  gaming at all. Display is Crisp although  it's not AMOLED but TFT panel.. Camera is somewhere average. I say put some. Extra bucks and get m30 s.... It's far more better Then this m20.,3
"I bought this device on 5th February on Amazon sale because I am using SAMSUNG mobiles from last 7-8 years and they never disappointed me but this device after using 10-15 days giving a major problem I.e. automatically operating touch/display,  back button is not working. Even I am not able pull down the notification panel.
And when I requested return or replace the device Amazon told me device will be picked up on 25 Feb. Today it's a 26th evening there is no response from Amazon team. Everyday I am approaching customer service executive they are just showing me the sympathy.",2
"It's a good ph. But very offen it does not respond to the touch, screen freezes. And the software or option for setting is not so good. It goes down screens after screen. Battery
charging is fast. And not enough number of font setting or message n call setting options. Like blocking the messages through phrase, or messages without nos.  For every other option we need to download other apps, which takes up resources. Also notification bar is not quite visible may be due to the icon design or font.",3
"It has some sort of lag, when I press an app it takes 1-2 seconds to open that on broadband and on cellular network it's worse. Touch also is not of the standsrds it should be. Front camera Is teribdle. Length of phone is not appropriate, suitable only for playing games or watching videos. Still stuck with two finger touch to zoom in camera mode. Overall not a satisfactory performance. I have used 10 phones of another company and they were fabulous in the same budget. But this one is a raise of money.",1
"My M 20 screen stopped working within 3 months. Samsung service centre told me that because of the scratch on polycarbonate body, my warranty is void.
Samsung, a multi billion dollar company, is trying to justify there shoddy built quality in lower end phones by blaming the customer.
Now they are asking 4500 for screen replacement... Plz let me add that there is not even a scratch on my screen.
Please dont buy this poor quality phone and dont trust their profit sucking service centres.",1
"I purchased Samsung Galaxy M20 last month from amazon. Just one month passed and we started noticing that battery discharges very fast as well as if we operate the mobile for 5mins, the mobile becomes extremely hot.
I don't blame supplier/vendor it's completely amazons responsibility to provide at least a good mobile to customer.
I had a big doubt on the products originality.
The supplier /vendor of such products as well as amazon should stop delivering nonsense products to customers.",3
I was overall happy with the performance of the phone. But one major thing that is missing is gorilla screen protection in this phone. I put a gorilla tempered screen protector on it. It has fallen once by me & still screen is broken very badly having hundreds of cracks & amazingly my tempered cover has not even got a single crack. Very poor screen strength. This was my first Samsung phone & experience has become horrible. My last phone Mi note4 has fallen like this numerous times but stayed intact.,2
"Buy if you want a SAMSUNG phone... For the price it's OK screen looks good, camera OK for the price... Performance is bad.. Even app multitasking has problems.. Hangs sometimes... I could have gone for redmi 7 if it was launched earlier...",3
"very poor front camera. while taking selfie background is almost white. sometime you cant find other object in background.  My intex 2mp can take batter selfie than m20.
Other good things is there in phone like display, big battery, nice looking etc. but cant ignore front camera problem.
So we asked for replacement and after 2-3 day we receive replacement (New Phone).
we found that Replacement device also has same problem so finally we decided to return it.",3
"Ordered a Charcoal black. Received the package of a Charcoal black. Inside was a sleazy M20 hiding in Midnight blue.

Now, since I bought it for Dad and he didn’t exactly care, didn’t bother returning. If it were me, who’s usually particular about colours, there’d be a bad review.",3
Phone is good great display and battery  life except within few weeks started getting issue of frequent screen freeze and ghost touch. Now need to visit service center now. I have two other Samsung phones in same price range using since 4 and 2 years respectively never seen any issue so am bit disappointed.,3
"After 10 or more years,  I found good mobile product from Samsung,and best price also.....but aft.1 month of usage I really disappointed  that ph.using almost 2.5 GB of ram and hang several time ,so I deleted my most apps than also it's used 2.6-2.7 GB and struc so many time ,pl.if u have more usable apps than dont but this phone....other than every thing superb durable, & in budget mobile....thanks",2
Speaker's are not good. Works in a sinusoidal pattern while talking to someone. Screen light is also working abnormally.,2
" As I got product delivered on 29th as I was busy in my office work as today on 05 the date the package I opened my new mobile but I found the screen is in broken condition, so as soon as resolve my issue or replace my mobile.",1
"Dear Amazon

I'm not satisfied with this phone...I'm using this phone since last year Aug 2018 and i found many faults...except battry backup nothing is good...hanging problem face sensor not work processor is too bad doesn't supprt any game like pubg..with this price you have an other best options but not this....And this is my last phone in Samsung which I'm using..aftr tht i don't wanna buy any samsung product....,2
"Face recognition is slow, image stabilization is worst when compared for other brands in the cost range.  Low light pics are not good at all. Upset with Selfe Canara. Not that much impressed with the battary stand by as well BCS as per the Samsung promiss. Except these, other things are good.",2
"I am writing these review after using of 20 days
Battery back is good,
Camera quality is not up to the mark and it will take 5 seconds to open,
and if you charging also getting heat the mobile, even if i am setting in AC room  also mobile is heating problem,
and while using the internet or watching any videos in YouTube mobile will get heat with in a minute. My suggestion is think and purchase the mobile. J6 mobile is better than this mobile as per my experience.Thank you.",3
"Don't buy this product.
Phone touch freezes for atleast 15 times a day. I need to wait for 30secs for it to work again. Sometimes because of this I won't be able to attend the call or click fast image and so ...
Camera Unusable, it's worse than previous Samsung mobile cameras at this price range. No detail in image quality, believe me I tried comparing side-by-side with Samsung j7 2016 model.
Finger print sensor dosent work atleast 40% of my attempts.",2
"Camere is is not up to 16MP standars. Battery heating up while charging and while playing videos. Touch is not working if screen glass used( after setting the touch sensitivity).
No return/refund accepting by customer care but they providing replacement which is not usefull as devise is not up to standards.",1
Waste of money. Humble request not to but. Too much lags like a j7 mobile . Already i am customer of samsung j7. Which I thought of throwing away the same problems arrises here at the time gaming and mobile internet turNed on. Mobile gets heated much and battery drains much like a water filled in damaged vessel... I bought the m20 mainly for the 4gb ram but it's first space the system itself used around 2.6gb ram space and the usable ram space is only 1.3 like a nor mal basic android mobile then what is the use of buyiNg this m20. Ate you trying to cheat your customers. Again launched m30 what is the use of cheating on m20 and launched m30,2
"This is the worst phone i had ever used in this price range and especially from samsung. My phone has started hanging from the second month of purchase.  Apps are opening automatically with out any touch command. Finally ends up in a restart or factory reset.  If u use a browser for 1 hr,  it will start behaving like a ghost.  Finger print senaor is a waste feature.  It will not work😪 Literally,  i lost my hard earned 10k🤕 i will never buy a samsung phone again.. never ever recomnend too.",1
"Actually it not a good phone.  Battery said is 5000 MAH while performance is lower than normal J7 model. Screen sensitivity is also a problem in this model and phone is damn heavy. Samsung installs its own app taking away space zo space is also a constraint in Samsung phones. Phone started hanging, you get a call but nothing to pick up on screen",1
"Worst model of Samsung.
Some phones are coming with inbuilt touch screen issues.
Refund not possible.
Worst customer service by Amazon.
Tough replacement options are there but it's only for 10 days.
Service centers are providing worst service, they don't know how to repair this perticular handset.
Hanging problems will apear in few days.
Overheating is a day to day issue.
Wide angle camera doesn't meet expectations.
Battery backup is good.",2
Its very bad mobile... Battery only written 5000 but its too much bad...my another mobile realme u1 has 3500 battery but it is better than this m20.. Morever it also lacks many features in comparison of other mobile at this price range..too much disappointed,1
I bought this M20 seven days back and it started malfunctioning where I cannot hear the other person's voice though they can hear me. I thought it might be a network or SIM issue. I tried different device with same SIM and same network area and it worked fine. This was happening repeatedly and on top of it the sound during the call drops to literally inaudible state. I need a replacement immediately!,1
"Battery life is good.
For marketing strategy Samsung do this product. But commercial wise it is too bad. It is not Volte. Camera Quality is average. When compared to this, the buyers go to MI 7S or 7 PRO for this budget.
SAMSUNG FOOLISH TO INDIAN CUSTOMERS,
The only good thing is Battery Life is Good.",3
"M20 may be the worst product of samsung.
Mobile touch and censor are very bad. Whereas other brands giving more options and quality in this price.
In Particularly my instrument,
1. Mobile got struck 4 to 5 times everyday.
2. Many times it showing sim not allowed and network dropped.
3. Applications operating automatically.
This mobile is having manufacturing defect.
Please take back and replace it with another instrument of the mobile.
Thanking you",2
"Cons : The display screen is very deligate. The screen got cracks in 6 months of usage( Used rough bcoz I used Nokia 6 before ) .
Pros : Full screen display is a brilliant design. The battery withstands for a days usage ( I dont use any gaming apps). The back end camera quality is good ( dual lens) and the front camera is pretty descent( selfies are automatically  done with the tinkering work). The metallic blue color is eye catching .",3
"I m not satisfied with this product and I m not expect these kind of product quality from Samsung... I odered this phone on 14 Feb 2019 and receive the same on 18 Feb 2019 and facing on the first day and the issues are...
1. Sim slot not perfect the sim not fit properly on sim slot....
2. Network issue...... all the time the call disconnected.....
3. Touch not working properly sometime it is so fast sometimes hang....

So I m not recommend any one to buy this...",1
"Pros
Good screen at this price
Overall build is impressive
Finger print reader really impressive
Impressive battery backup aprox1.5 day after full charge
Pros
Processor could be better' at this price
Slow after using 4 months
Camera below avserage
It takes bit long time to full charge",3
"Stops working after 7-8 months , i have been using it for a year now first 6 months it worked smoothly but afterwards it started lagging,  major apps are not performing like Netflix Amazon and other streaming.

Battery life is the only best thing in it.

Phone is performing very poorly for last 4-5 months, i tried resetting and all but still facing the same issues, IDk if my device is faulty or all are the same. Beware",1
"Everything else is great and perfect, but the phone does a horrible job with getting signal.

I loved the camera, performance, screen, battery span, but signal reception is so bad, my initial opinion of a 6-star(for budget phone) came down to 2-star.

I'm now using hotspot for others from many places to get internet",2
"Worst Samsung phone manufactured till date.
After 4 days of usage the cell started to hang a lot and it's sometimes even malfunctions.
I am very much disappointed. Never buy this phone guys believe me.",1
"I bought this phone for my father 4 days ago and here are my views objectively:
1. Phone is somewhat heavier.
2. It's touchscreen doesn't work well. You have to tap it multiple times to make it go.
3. It hangs as well.
4. The phone charger is too short in length...weirdly short.

Rest..I need time to use and then I shall update my review accordingly. On the whole, being a regular and diehard Samsung customer and user- I am honestly disappointed this time.",3
"This is the First time for me to give review:

Very very worst product ...
Not at all worth for money...
There is no return at all only Replace....

Pls don't purchase this one...",1
"Phone is laggy and gets hanged at some occasions. Even though interface has been improved but not improved enough to be smooth. Better options in lesser price Are available in Asusu, Xiaomi and other brands.

Phone just stops responding when you are getting call or when using chrome browser. Its so irritating at times that you feel like hitting it against wall. I am really frustrated while using this phone.

I have a asus max m1 pro, its much better than this phone and 4K cheaper. The down side of m1 max pro is its camera. Its very poor and also some of the basic functions like Android Auto doesn’t work.",1
"Actually this phone is well but little  bit problem  in hanging sometimes and phone cameras  are well specially back camera is very good but problem in other side. when clicking for photo sometimes the screen bottoms r not properly working that's why i were click on volume key. Volume in speaker is not good enough as usual . SUGGESTION ,If fingerprints sensor use as a photo click bottom it will be better. Please think about it and I hope this problem solve  in next upgrade software.",3
"If you ask me real feedback for 4gb-64gb...its worst phone ever with such config... I thought I would have upgraded with Samsung but my couple of years old MI4 is far far better in performance even today...
This phone really sucks..hangs..etc..etc..",1
I discharged the battery to 0% and then i charged the battery to 100% and let it in switched off condition till morning and in morning when i switch it on then the battery percentage was 40 even the i had not insert sim card and didn't installed any app after that the battery is not giving good backup i thik they delivered a refurbished mobile phone i am not at all impressed by amazon and may be not gonna use it again because they are not helping me and not returning or exchanging the product. Worst experience....,1
"Cons :
1. I have brought  this by seeing  5000 mAh battery. Worst battery I have seen. I have replaced  with the Mi Note 5 pro which has 4000 mAh battery but very impressive.

2.
2.Without  any usage it mobile heating is there another  problem with  the  M20.

Pros:
1. Mobile display, touch quality looks, camera are very good .....Samsung quality  is  good  here.

Lastly if u are heavy user don't buy this at all.",3
"The product is just fine for people with tight budget nothing impressive, have issues with fingerprint reader, gets hung in between of whatever I do, final result a petty phone in my eyes will try to change it as soon as possible, however @Samsung never fails in one customer expectations and that is

A crappy phone will always stay crappy in low budgets a new motto of Samsung should make their new vision with this statement",1
"Worst phone I ever  purchased in my life. Battery draining super fast, overheating, interface hanging, speaker problem. Amazon  refused to return or refund by harassing through blannco app even they have the return  policy. Phone is very  bad and Amazon is very very bad. Please  don't  purchase this phone. Don't purchase  any  phone in Amazon  because  practically  there's  no return  or replacement. Amazon also not giving 0 star rating  option and forced us to give 1 star rating.",1
Samsung meant quality.. I had bought this phone a month back but the screen went dead within 15 days. The mobile has no external damage. But Samsung service engineers are saying that it is internal damage and the repairs cannot be covered under warranty. Are asking me to pay Rs.4000 for screen replacement. How come I am responsible for internal damage. What if the piece itself had been defective? How am I supposed to verify that..Request Amazon to look into the same..Will request buyers to stay away from the phone..,1
"Already used S7
Using S8

Now i have trusted and bought this as a standby phone
Bought is on the first day of sale

Used and for almost a  month

The touch screen is not working properly since 15 days its so irritating
Automatically its starts sensing the touch and all the anything gets open all of a sudden

Hate this phone",1
"(1) design was very ugly fully made out of cheap pollycarbonate easily scratch, mobile was very thick and heavy.even box quality is cheap.
(3) display was vibrant and bright no complain.
(2) Camera quality was under average clarity was missing not up to the mark.
(3) battery backup was good you will not disappoint and full charge in 2h15min
(4) Gaming was very bad in this phone heats up very quickly not able to play games like pubg even on low graphics frame dorps.",3
"Fingerprint reader doesn't work even when there is little bit of moisture like sweat on scanner.And sweating is inevitably in countries like India even in the winters.Camera is good and performance is ok.
After about 8 months of using this phone i am writing this.The touchscreen hangs when you watch videos in youtube or netflix in fullscreen. Then you have to lock the phone and unlock it again for the touchscreen  to start responding.Really disappointed with this",1
"1)Vibration Motor is disabled.
2)Front camera performance is worst.Images  are soft and no details at all
3)Back camera has lot of bugs.
a)No EIS
b) Pictures are coming soft.
c)Hdr is not working properly
d)Night sight is not present.
4) TFT Display quality is not good
5)15W fast charger is taking  more time to. Charge the Device from 0-100%.
6) Portrait shots for both front and back cameras are coming worst.",3
"Compare to price best device, specially from Samsung brand.no one can beat this brand quality & after sale support (service) excellent user interface One UI. But some issues r is available,Please Samsung fix it soon, battery, camara & network issues, this issue 100% resolve samsung from ota update",3
I bought this phone after reading so many positive reviews but i am highly disappointed!! The phone calls get disconnected every few minutes ...the voice breaks ...very irritating to spk to someone using this phone...i want to replace the phone how do i do it,1
"I bought this product 3 days ago & it is totally a wastage of money. No return from amazon
1. Battery life worst
2. Video cannot strech to the notch
3. Touch didn't work sometimes
4. The processor is too bad & slow sometimes it hangs
5. You can't even play PUBG on low settings
6. Gamers please ignore this
7. Worst samsung product",1
"There are forced ads in the mobile the moment u on the screen. Sometimes the phone also hangs a bit and sometimes the keys don't work at all forcing a user to restart the phone..

Samsung it's important either you cut down the cost substantialy or improve the features of your phone.",2
"This is the worst product I have seen. Speed is very slow. I have spoken with Amazon technician, he asked me to go for factory reset and do not download basic m app like WhatsApp, bookmy show, etc..",1
"This phone has excellent battery life
Camera is not good
Processor is very poor
And the worst thing is that, i have  used it only  10 days and it start hangs while it has 4GB /64
so plz don't busy this product
I only used Samsung phones but this product ,but this product break my trust ever ..",1
"Everything is average in this mobile and doesn't fulfill any specifications with 100%accuracy.
The mobile gets over heated and application lags and fast charging doesn't work fast.  it's just 20 days before I bought this phone.. Not a good choice if you are a rough user of phone.  this mob is suitable only for old people who can use to make calls and if you tend to use more then u feel like holding a hot pan in your hand..",1
"Don't buy it. Battery don't last long for a 5k mah. It won't connect to all WiFi connections (never seen such a thing even in low grade phones). Strange that it displays only 4 WiFi available when other phones detect more than 10 WiFi s. Display too bright even if set on minimum. Performance poor. Front cam notch is annoying. Fing print sensor placed too high.
)",1
 This phone is not at all same to samsung other phones it will work perfect for 2-3 months but after that it will show serious issues i gifted it to my dad and he kept his phone very carefully i use i phone and samsung can never match the standard of apple i have no trust in this company anymore i will suggest to buy phone of vivo or mi this is total waste of money,1
"I think, samsung have given one of the pathetic product(m20). They have comprised too much on quality just to save money. Very dispointed with this product. To compete with redmi, vivo, oppo and realme samsung may have launched m series but on the front of hardware and quality they have cheated the customer.
I would suggest please do not go for M20. You may get better product on same price range. If anyone is interested to buy M20 they can go ahead on their own risk.",1
"This is worst mobile phone made by Samsung first time
Its touch not work properly which is most important thing
Display auto brightness is also not work frequently
First time wrong item purchase on Amazon",1
"All is good but i found two issues after using aprox 2 month .
1. Face unlock not working as stander.
2. Sound of speakers is low as compare to other phone but base of sound is good.
After 5 minth of use
Phone starte banding issue and when go in service center they it is not cover in warranty.
So strongly i say dont bye this product.",1
"I have returned the phone in 4 days .
On first day i found a little bit of lagging while playing pubg .
On second day i checked its stats on cpu-z . wrong processor information .
On third day  screen started flickering .
On fourth day display fully blank .phone dead .
Battery backup is good and charges fast .
Sound quality not so good .
If you are a heavy user dont buy it .",1
"Battery life is good. Camera is decent, could be better. The biggest problem is with the touch screen, the full screen display has made it very difficult. If you are holding the phone while sleeping it will touch anywhere and the phone just misbehaves until you sit upright. This is very frustrating and honestly shows that Samsung hasn't put much effort is optimising this touch glitch. Don't buy this phone.",3
"Not speedy fingerprint is slow camera is ok ok..battery is good...charging is fast , display is ok, but slow motion and timelapse options not there in camera .memory management is too worst... don't go for it , if u really want Samsung go for a50 or a70...don't buy it's a serious warning",1
"Worst phone i ever bought on amazon, worst built quality, looks cool but very bad built quality, after a use of a week, because of fallen from a hand on ground tuffened glass not broked but entire display cracked, 50₹ tuffened glass is more strong than this phone's display.",1
I have bought samsung m20 two months back. Phone charging time is too late. Its getting charge 9% to 19% for one hours. It will take full charging around 7 to 8 hours. Escalated to customer support,2
"Very bad performance by the phone. Not recommended.  My money went at loss. I could get very good phone from other brands with the same price. Its about to be a month and I am started facing software issue with this phone. The camera is bad, sound is very low. And more over you can't return the phone. Only replace is available.  That really not accepted",1
"I got this phone on 17th of this month. It took more than twelve  hours  for complete  charge ! I am first time using smart  phone, so I've no idea of duration  charging.  Later  on realized through my colleague that it should take just 2 hrs for complete  charging . I feel ditched . Can any body there to listen.  COME ON AMAZON.",1
"First of all if u are looking for a gaming smartphone, this one is absolutely not good. After 5 month of usage, I'm going to sell this due to FULL HANGING.  While playing pubg or non playing anything, this m20 will be lag. I dont know why. Daily minimum 6 times it will be hang. So don't buy it..If u are lokking for normal use,this one is perfect. I LOVE THE BATTERY CAPACITY...Its awesome..Camera also great. Only fault is Processor. Always hang.",3
"1st. FINGERPRINT sensor is best but secondary fingerprint record is not that effective as primary one.
2nd. Camera good in medium light but it you look for low light camera it's not a choice to go with.
3rd. Battery life is not as much when compared to mAh it has still manageable to burn a full day.
4th. Phone may arise with issue for touch and blackout sometime not everytime but exceptions are always there.",3
"1.Durability of screen is weakest, a normal half feet drop cracked its screen.
2.finger print sensor is quick to respond but the out covering have very thin layer of coating and eventually it got removed causing failure in finger print security.
3.It lacks so much , some times its very frustrating.

1.Long battery life.
2.better camera in this price range.
3.Two LTE sim slots.
4. Looked very premium in hand.",3
"Fail sections- Camera, no Dolby Atmos, Processor sucks battery fast 5000=3500 same, Sound is very low on speaker.
Display picture quality Awesome.
Camera quality is poor even my moto g2 8MP camera is good in room low light. Camera software update urgently needed. Actually I think trusted company gives original 8mp & 13mp.
I think i had to buy U1 in this price range.",1
I am really annoyed to purchase this phone. Hardly a month has passed and the phone has started giving problem of battery. It is getting full charged and thereafter losing all charge in just 3-4hours without using internet also. I won't recommend this phone to anyone.,1
"I bought it Feb2019, my experience with this phone is average.  After 1 yr of usage I am writing this review

Pros
1.Camera quality is ok, it comes with live focus mode.
2. When it comes to battery, I use to watch youtube continuesly and I ll use chatting , for me it is coming 10hrs hrs. If I don't watch too much then it will come for one day.

3. Its sleek design is superb.

4. It comes with inbuilt anti virus powered by Mc cafe.

Cons

1. Finger print should have come in front side. Every time it is difficult to find out location of finger print sensor.
2. Touch is slow, sometimes it is stucking",3
"Hi,
Extremely poor responce from team Amazon fir the first time.
No replacements nor any RETURN, directs the option for some App to cross check issue if your fone which in turn doesnt work.
One cant talk of the signal is 50% in bar, while MI Phones work even when the signal is 20%-25%. The guy on the other side cant listen even ur sound if the signal is nit 100%.
One friend facing the same issue.",1
"In description ,It claims about 15 W fast power charger,but actually it is not",1
Worst product.. wasted my money !! 4gb ram and the phone lags even when the storage is 10% used and no gaming.. phone lags in every aspect and screen freezes for few seconds. Touch irresponsive ! Have comained to samsung and all they say is to format .. after which the same problem still continues. I would prefer a MI phones anytime than this crappy phone from samsung,2
"I purchase this mobile (Samsung Galaxy M20) 3 months back, now display got damaged. We didn't do any mishandling, suddenly display got the problem. The service centre in guwahati said that this is our fault and it won't come under warranty. Within 3 months of purchase, I am forced to pay around 5000 rupees to change the display.  Previously Also I had samsung galaxy and its performance was not good. All my experience with Samsung is worst.",1
"Boot Loop, No Turning On, Just Vibrates, Keeps Restarting, no power on samsung galaxy m20
PHONE SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE ISSUES ARE THERE,
THEY ACCEPT THEIR FAULT BUT NOT READY TO DO ANYTHING FOR IT. LOST MY IMPORTANT DATA, WASTED MY TIME AS WELL AS MONEY ON THIS WASTE PHONE AND USELESS BRAND ASSURED COMPANY.
I have used other samsung phones too they too do this on and off by own.
WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM SAMSUNG.",1
Phone looks premium from the front but cheap from the back because it's just plastic .but camera is awesome .front camera is so.so.build quality is Mediocre. If ubget a back cover then it looks good .over all good for the price but on the first day the phone started lagging.touch sensor are mediocre as well.screen is not as bright as it should be.,2
The phone is overall good value for money. The position of the fingerprint reader in the back is prone to scratches. So be careful how you maintain it. I love that it lasts me a whole day and solid for 6 to 7 episodes. The glance screen by Samsung is also a useful feature that puts quality images on the phone lockscreen making it look beautiful especially with such a large and filling screen. It's a very decent buy for temporary usage if you do not use camera for any quality shoots. The sound is also good with the speakers on the bottom. You'll enjoy it,3
"Standing tall to their name, Samsung again proves their mettle in producing shit phone like this.  Display gone within a couple of month. The perennial problem of hanging is there, phone lags as always the case with the brand. Had known of these issues before buying but shown some faith and bought the phone. Now regretting the decision. Would not recommend anyone to buy any mid range phones of Samsung. Go for some other brand but Samsung.",1
"Battery backup sucks. Does not even last whole 24 hours with mild internet usage and 2-3 hours of call time.
Worst that my previous phone, honor 7 that had 4000 mAh battery.

Body is not metal and feels like cheap plastic ...cover is must...

Wish there was an option to return",2
The Charging pin of this handset is different from previous models of Samsung as a result only cable supplied with the handset can be used for charging. Want to know any adopters or converters are available which can fixed with the handset charging point and all the data cable can be made compatible.,2
"I am very very disappointed and i regret i choose Samsung for the 1st time. Till 1st week the display was working fine ,later i got problem with touch not working ,screen freezing . I even went to Samsung service care at jayanagar named Samsung care point , they told tht ""display is out of stock and when it will get back they gonna call back"" but i never received call and even today i am facing pblm. Please if possible help me fix this.",1
"The Battery life is very Poor. Not sustain more than 6 hr... showing display of battery 80% charged only even keep the mobile charged for whole night..On 21/09/2019 suddenly display of the mobile black out..Whereas it is ringing while someone gives call  but could not receive the call..
I want to return the handset..It very unfortunate that Amazon sells such type of defective handset to customer..

"Face recognition has bug that it unlocks with photo of face .we tested this face recognition application .. it unlock when you close your eyes . Waste product don't buy it , called customer care they told useless solution that doesn't work .thanks for Samsung ..good bye... Don't buy this product..",1
"It got delivered to me just now..and while booting it up.. i figured that microsd card which s samsung brand itself is not fitting into the sim tray. I struggled and finally gave up.  I hv been using samsung for more then 10 years, this for the first time it has happened that a basic thing like microsd could bot fit in. This shows the level of quality commitment offered  by samsung. Have no choice but to return it",1
The phone I purchased start using after 10 days it become switch off by itself and I asked about replace then amazon told that it was already ten days over u contact Samsung people ten I called up Samsung customer care then they directed me to Samsung service and they told me that its software problem and update thrice still iam facing same problem then what should u I do now,1
"Only in month hanging problem in this phone. Camera quality is very bad. While watching movie its heating so much. Further main issue with amazon not giving good services to customer, product seem like local and useless. No value for money by purchasing products from amazon. Amazon usually put their website issues on customer that customer have done mistake while order. They always made customer fool that y customer don't know how to order.
I request you to not buy product",1
"very poor quality of camera, abnormally heating, you can make omlet from a egg easily by this phone...and after one week use it start hanging...very very bad phone in this budget...finger print read not properly, face unlock is not working good..and camera quality is very poor.. network strength is bad than other phone in the same place, this phone is good for nothing without display and battery performance. don't waste money for it, don't buy this phone..",1
Device that I received performance  is not good in terms of receiving signals and data speed and strucking while using it. I need to restart every time when it is happening and suddenly stop receiving data when I am using mobile data and showing it is not registered ... if I restart again it will work for some time... facing problem with the device I received...,3
Packaging is bad..and guys please don’t buy this phone if u are a pubG player..camera quality is very low. Other mid range phone is far batter than this phone .and the brand name of this phone is sucks ..On 28th jan they are saying this phone is this and this phone is that all are fakeee..I am a gamer and I don’t like this phone at all.,1
"At this range this is a good product, but proximity sensor does not work most of time, front camera is not as of high quality, under lights it seems to be 2mp camera, little bugs and hang some time while playing pub G or smack down 2k18, yes fast charging but drain too fast 5000 mAH battery should stay longer.",3
"The phone I received and gifted to my mother on same day. Later I came to know that sim slot was faulty, and it appears that signal strength is also w.r.t. my Redmi phone. As the phone was not with me otherwise I would have returned it .",2
"Not at all happy with the phone. I think amazon sells refurbished item as fresh one.
1.Voice quality ver bad
2. Network issue. My old moto phone was getting better network same place.
3. Battery also gets discharged very quickly.
I m not sure if all samsung phone has same issue but i baught this from amazon and facing this issue.looks like defective piece.",2
"The mobile is good by design and performance
The display is nice with water drop v notch
but camera is little disappointing front camera is not upto the mark
Ya u can bye this phone for its design and display and for the brand name Samsung nothing else special abt it, note that many other brands too provide this design and display",3
"My Samsung Galaxy M20 phone ,which was booked on 14th Feb'19 & delivered on 16th February, 2019.
Since last two days (from 27th Feb'19) the phone is getting hanged frequently. This is very very unfortunate .
Now I want to replace the phone with new good one, which I can use smoothly.",2
"The phone built quality is very good and it feel like a premium phone. But Camera picture quality is okay okay. We can expect from more than this Samsung need to consider this bcoz Samsung already set standard by other models then y this is done with M20. If the reason is just to keep the price low, then I'll say Other options are available in market within the same price. Rest all are good.",3
"One of the worst phone. I was not expecting such a bad quality from Samsung. Main issue is the speaker, it is very noisy.

While talking or playing songs, there is vibration in the phone due to noisy speakers.

I called Amazon for phone inspection. Twice they scheduled that a technician will come to inspect the phone. Both the times no one came to my home to inspect it. They closed the issue at their end only.",1
"I have purchased M20 64 GB phone in April-19 and after using 2months it has collapsed and i visited Samsung customer care adarsh nagar, delhi they replaced its speaker and charging point and said it will work fine and even after a week it again switched off and now they again repaired it and said now we have changed its display, now you think twice or thrice before buying M20 phone , totally a bad experience , even M series of Samsung not good at all.",1
"Even i am facing this issue.. I have already live in rural area but this phone is network connectivity so poor and many more relative;s smartphones well working in rural area . But problem still remain unresolved.. I am now looking to sell out this device because no other option is left ...I would advice you also to find ways to sell out this product..
Worst service by samsung.... I would never recommend samsung to any of my friends and relatives.",1
"Got phone on 3rd sale.The phone had a physical damage.returned and got a refund as there was no stock.so no comments on other features,but 5 GHz wifi is not supported.giving 1 star as I did not use is to give any feature review",1
"Hang Problem is a still issue for Samsung , and Price Drop within weeks also a still issue for Samsung . By emotional Tv ads Samsung knows very well how to make customers "" c"" and fool .",1
The Worst phone one can ever get.. It gets hanging frequently... Connection of call getting worse... Internet connection getting worse.... I have never used such useless phone ever... It's packaging and mobile box was also not as good as compare to a Chinese smartphone of 3000 rupees,1
"I purchased  the phone 21 Feb 2020 but this phone have following problems-
1.hang problem
2.In specification show it work at 4g but it not work at 4g
3.very slow
4.Rear camera is poor
5.Phone have heating problem
6.Amazone site not have good response  and solution when I face these problems
Please  no one purchase  any electronic  item from Amazone otherwise you will feel good like me .They provide faulty items.",1
I hate samsung technical support as the solution they provided to unlock the SIM if i use a SIM of another country other than  India is to call for 10 mins from the Indian SIM on international roaming.  Whoo on earth will pay international roaming charges.  They need to provide a technical solution.,1
overall Samsung M20 is good .....rather ill rate it average ...if you are looking for battery life its not an option as the battery drains very fast with mobile data and the heavy applications like Games etc... sound and camera with samsung delivered is as expected ....overall ill rate it 3-star phone two stars deducted for battery life .....Seller rocks as the product were delivered on time.,3
"Look wise it's good but over all performance wise rating is rating 3 only. Its finger print sensor detects very slow, battery backup is not upto the mark, discharges very fast, more over the packing from Amazon is very very very poooooor as it has come in mobile box & further Amazon has put his cover and forwarded without any additional protection, now slowly heating problem started. So choose wisely.",3
"Camara is too bad, it's not even 5mp. I am a samsung fan for the last 10 years, but first time wanted to return my device , samsung do not degrade your brand by following your compitatiors. I had galaxy j8 which is still working good for the last 1.5 years, but m20 64 gb is the first worst model in galaxy series..
Do not go for this .",1
"Writting this review after using 6 days.
Cons:
1. Over heating during normal use, even not installed any game or heavy applications.

 Pros:
1. Battery and charging good

3. Sound quality ok.

Couldn't. Afford 13k only for battery, screen display and sound.",1

I want my phone exchange.
Thats it.",1
"This is a terrible phone which disappoints big time on the basic feature performance.

Fingerprint reader doesn't work smoothly (often have to use password). Touchscreen isn't responsive.

It appears as if Samsung tried to do a low cast imitation of Xiaomi, but has failed miserably.

The camera and durability of the phone is average.

Regret purchasing this, will opt for Redmi soon",1
"Overall phone is ok but battery performance not as expected. Should have been more considering the specs of 5000 mAh and that too after less to medium usage. Also, many junk apps are there with no options to uninstall. Does not meet the expectattions.",3
"Description of mobile is very interesting to read...but the performance is equivalent to local company handsets...camera quality is like 2mp..
Preloaded apps occupied 12GB space..when 3 GB data restored the set started hanging...problems in unlocking by face and fingers...retried registration of face and finger data  still had facing problems....",1

Very low quality camara. I tried to return my phone. But no return is available. I sold it in mobile shop and for 10500. And I brought nokia 6.1 plus. No support from Amazon for return. Don't buy it. Not worth at all,1
"I am not happy with  Samsung Galaxy M20 (Charcoal Black, 4+64GB). it's heat up with in 10 min if you are taking or watching you tube video.
 After amazon tester came then he said please don't on internet more or it has metallic body that why it's heat up. i can not replace it till it's heat up till 50 temp.
 my suggestion don't buy this phone and don't by any phone from amazon because they gives excuses which is not acceptable...",1
"it's not working properly. The phone is hanging to much, we need to switch it off it in every 5-10 minutes. this is the condition of the phone with minimum usage, think about the time when it will be used for hours. I have already taken the phone twice to Samsung care in its first month only.",1
"This is the worst phone i had ever purchased.
Do Not buy this product (samsung m20) as it is a wastage of money.
problems start arising within the three months of purchase. Overall quality of this phone is very poor, finger print sensor is slow in response, touch screen got damged within month, issue of battery charging and heating begins to pop up beside other issues. My advice to all potential buyers is no to go for this phone",1
"Bought it for my mom!
There is a issue with the touch screen of this phone. Updates helped a lot for the touch fix. But still i would cut some points for the touch! (May be a issue only with my device but the touch seems a bit late in response sometimes!)

Battery: As expected! Excellent!

Fingerprint: Sensor works fine! But we can add only 3 fingerprints!",3
"Fingerprint reader is good one we can easily access to the phone.
Rear camera quality is excellent, Samsung can also improve the quality of selfie camera
Battery life not completely good phone is not behaving like 5000 mah battery phone.
Overall 50-50 rating for the complete phone",3
"Never saw such a bad phone, stopped working after few days use. Service centre replaced mother board and lost lot of data. Never buy Samsung cheap phones as their reliability is zero",1
frnds plz believe me its the waste phone in the world. the phone which i ordered is being switching off very frequently now i cant even replace it back .when i showed this piece to the showroom they are also telling that its manufacture defect. here its nt the mistake of amazon nor seller its problem of manufacturing so disgusting never expected this from samsung ............!!!!!,1
"Lags a lot to open apps, camera is very bad, charging seems like it takes forever to just charge 10%, not in the list phones that can be exchanged on Amazon, fingerprint reader is also very slow, face unlock is for just to mention in feature list not usable again for same reason very slow.",1
"Dear Team ,

The phone is only Good to see However Its always getting Hanged while operations.

Horrible product it worked well for 1 month now it is not working at all. Such a waste of money on this. Once the most trusted brand Samsung has continuously lead down the expectations of the customers. Will never buy any Samsung product in life and will not recommende to buy.,1
"this is the worst product ever i have used .

suddenly freezes for some time .",1

I raised this concern to Amazon they told reset the phone but problem still exist then told to install blancco diagnostic app. After running this app they told me phone is ok from Amazon side but problem still exist.

"After I opened the box, I found that just above the charging port there is a defect on the border of the display like a cavity and also there was some dust in between the display and it's border. For a new product like this, I didn't expected this kind of quality and I don't know what the company is doing in the name of QUALITY ASSURANCE. I got the product on 3rd March, but still the replacement process hasn't started yet. This is completely not acceptable.",1
"I'm giving my review after the usage of m20 for a couple of months, were I found the fingerprint response is slow, charging time is little longer, and the camera quality is Ok not too bad nor too good, overall it's a good phone in this price range. We can't expect more or compare this phone with high end models, for those who need every option with a small budget, can definitely go for it without any hesitation.",3
"This phone has severe hitting issue,It hits up while you are talking on phone with your internet connection running.Playing even a low graphics game like 8 ball pool also hits up the phone to such an extend as if you have played pubg for more than a hour.If you guys are looking to buy a back up phone only  for calling and no other stuff, this is good phone but please dont preffer this phone for camera, and battery both are pathetic.",1
"1. Battery is life is very very poor. Wihtout internet normall  usage itself bettery is Drain very very fast.
2. Auto brightness is not working properly.
3. Charging USB cable length is very small. If you are buying this mobile you have buy separate length cable.
4. No headphones.
This is not worth product.
Amazon took least bother when we raised the complaint. Very unhappy shopping experience with Amazon.",1
"I think Software issues is there, often mobile hanging, mobile data not supported often in LTE,

"In this phone some network related serious issue. I tried different cellular network (Vodafone, airtel, jio and idea) but in all networks call dropping and if you talk more than 2-3 min then trouble in hearing from receiver end.

Highly disappointed.. if possible need help",1
I have received this mobile on 13feb2019. I used for 5 days after installing required apps it getting restarted.

Waste of money, never expect such product from samsung.

Too disappointed.",1
"Good  looking  phone. Finger print lock is not fast enough.
Battery  is up to  the  mark.  No hear phones, no back cover and no screen guard provided. We need to spend another  thousand rupees  for these items.  One  more  drawback is  it is only support type C charging cable and cable length is very short. To much weight. Very bad design. Redmi 7a or 6a are far better than this junk product",1
"Worst product at this price range battery life-3 to 4 hours.
Camera quality  is poor image is not stable in front camera while Making video.
Start hanging  sometimes.

Touch screen response is bad.
Don't  buy this product  at this price range you can get better phone from other brands in this price range  vivo,oppo,mi, Nokia,realme.
Fingerprint sensor response is very slow.",1
"I purchased samsung M20 on 23rd april, 2019 and within 2 weeks the lcd panel started leaking from inside. there was no visible external damage or scratches & the service centre is refusing to service it. These low cost smartphones do not maintain quality control and the service team is avoiding to take liability by spinning some technical jargon unknown to the customers.",1
"Worst product and waste of money. Exactly after a month it has stopped working and getting restarting frequently and quality of the product is at ground level.
Worst Camera. Battery backup is not up to the mark while compared with 5000mah battery phones. Please don't buy this product",1

"I regret purchasing this mobile. This phone has very soft, delicate Display which immediately cracked after falling from just minimal distance. And the cost for new display is 4450 Inr. These guys makes customer fool easily we get trapped for these type of phones. they knew incident will happen like this and will earn more than enough money from the customer.

Apart from Battery and camera everything is priceless.",1
"This product is very bad. Whenever I open the phone ads pop up frequently and through chrome I blocked pop ups and redirects even though, the ads popped up. The camera quality of the phone is very poor.Whenever I use the phone for 40-50 minutes, the phone gets heated.You cannot download marnier apps as it requires so much MB. I suggest not to buy this phone.I hope my review is helpful to anyone deciding to buy this product.",1

I bought  samsung again thinking at least now with m series they will give a great product but no. Plz don't buy samsung. Samsungs moisture  detector  is faulty unable to charge when moisture is detected in charging slot. Even when phone has not been in contact of water it just keeps annoying  you. And there is no option  to shut down that sensor. When its urgent to charge your  phone sensor suddenly just detects moisture.,1

Display is good for entertainment and media.
Camera is meh.
Phone heated like crazy high the first few months like even when i make a phone call reached 45 degrees.
Now it is normal or maybe i got used to the heat XD.
Gaming is meh.
If u use your phone primarily for media and entertainment i.e netflix youtube then go for this device.",3
Don't buy this phone not even by mistake. It's useless buy xiaomi its better than this. Exynos is trash it even hangs while playing bubble shooter!!!! Network keeps disconnecting for no reason and while complaining to company they don't give a damn. Camera is worse than even redmi 4A .Battery keeps dropping after 2 weeks. Since i bought this phone fingerprint works only twice that too after cleaning the sensor for hours.,1

I had bought this phone only 4 months back. It has a big problem of randomly detecting moisture and then giving up on charging until the moisture goes away.  This happens so frequently that the phone is practically useless. I am having to buy another non-samsung (I hate you samsung for wasting my 13k Rupees) phone within 4 moths of buying this one. Other friends who have a samsung phones have reported similar problem.,1
Please rethink before buying this phone. Just suffering after purchasing this phone. Voice during call is not clear where network is weak but Amazon will not help u out as there software will not track this problem. I have compared the issue with other phone where there is no issue with same network. Amazon just a waste of money and time.,1
"this moblie M20 not working properly. there is somany technical issues like over heat the set, signal problems, net problem and other issues. I am not satisfy with this mobile. Battery standing is very low. its discharged speedily.

More than average functions.

After using more than 1 month I feel this is the worst phone.",1
Not worth price since redmi and others gives better value for money,3
Regarding the performance wise it was okayaish but the screen is damn worse.I did made screen to be protected by a 500rs screengaurd but the screen is broken due to accidental fall .The thing which is further worsing is replacement is not in warranty and cost of replacing of the screen is half the rate.Better thing is oneplus and Nokia mobiles worst samsung and worst Customer feedback and response,1

"1)Screen light is bad which cause irritation to eye especially left

"The processor may not be the fastest available, but that battery life is immense. I can go on for 1 and a half day, probably 2 days without charging for normal usage. Camera is great for the price. Fingerprint reader is good. The face unlock is also very awesome and accurate.

However there are some bugs in the android pie software but samsung has released some updates to remove them.",3

"Galaxy M20 is better option in the range around ₹12000. But it is bit heavy and what company claims of 500 mAh, I don’t think it gives back up as per it’s efficiency. Company claims for video playing more than 20 hours. That is also fake. And the worst thing I experienced is not able to download many important apps from PLAY STORE. I would suggest to go for other options who is bit techy.",3

Fingerprint Reader : Sometimes need to touch 2-3 times for the phone to unlock
Camera Quality : Average

Overall I found it Value for Money. u cant ask for anything more in 10K",3
"In m20 we found heating issues after run youtube 20 minutes or surfing

every time for wake up we press Button , it is irritating at the time of operating

"before bying this i used honor 7x . i can say that the user experiance of samsung m20 is below the level of honor 7x. one thing where i desapointed more is a camera department, camera performance and image quality are far better in honor 7x. i should order 2 year old honor 7x instead of ordering samsung m20",3
"Initially I was very happy with this phone. But gradually as I started using it started lagging. Now after 6 months of time it is giving so much of trouble, that I even I cant pick up the call on time. It takes 5 - 10 seconds to an enter text. I have uninstalled all my apps, thinking of my apps might be slowing this phone, but nothing worked out. It still at same condition. Better not to go for this phone.",2
"Physical: It's a very very very poor quality phone. You can see openings. You can feel glue in some places. Poor quality plastics.
Technical: display is good. Battery is really good. Sound quality is useless. Camera is useless. I'm bored within 10 days of use. It hangs sometimes.
Software: worst phone ever. Apps stop working after some days though everything is ok.",1
"I think this is the world's waste phone. Buying this phone means wasting money. Since 20days I'm using this. within this time I want almost 5 times to customers care to rectify phone problm. But no use. Camera, fingerprint are not working, phone hanging. Battery is also not good. I'm requesting Amazon to tell samsung to stop their mobile manufacturing. Why cheating people.",1
"I got this phone at today overall is good,
just one thing disappointed to me that is front camera of this phone is very bad quality,
After captured photo Quality of image  looks like the 2mp camera,
Always showing ads too much when we opened to any app,
they are selling ads not phone
Not recommended to all
So please don't buy",1
"Amazing phone stop wasting your money on vivo or oppo, buy this sturdy, amazing, hats-off phone.
really really amazing phone
the camera quality is decent ( better than redmi note 7)
the face unlock takes only 4seconds to unlock the handset
up to date android version (pie)
blazingly amazing experience UI
sound quality is wonderful (Dolby Atmos, rocked the ground)
.........",3
I purchased samsung product after a log thinking that now they come with great features I.e 4 gb/64 gb great operating system and 5000 mah battery but after purchasing it it realise rajy this was totally wastage of money battery is equal/run to 1800 mah started hanging slow process. Overall waste of money plz don't go for it.,1
"Battery life is amazing it will work around a day once charged.
Finger print sensor is little slow to detect the finger and it takes time to open up.
Talking about camera rear camera is perfect but when we use wide angle camera the picture quality is blurred a little bit.
Sometimes screen touch is not working as usual Samsung hanging problem.
Overall the phone but good but as I expected.",1
"Disappointing camera quality which is not the property of Samsung in case of other mobiles, although with low price Samsung would not have given up in its strengths (camera quality). Charging the mobile completely takes more than 1.5 hours.",3
"Don't go for this mobile if u r a gamer.
All the reviews about this phone being able to play pubg smoothly are absolutely rubbish.
The phone starts suffocating even on lowest graphic settings in pubg. For everything else like battery, camera, display etc.the phone is good for its price.
I bought this for playing pubg and am highly disappointed with the processor performance. U could have done better Samsung!",1
Product is goos in the sense of its display and battery backup. But if you talk about camera. I will rate it 1. Not even you can compare it with  competitor phones. There is one issue which i found. While using two sim you will get speed on first slot sim not on the other slot sim.,2
"Good product. Value for money.  The mobile gets slow when we start using too many apps simultaneously and many apps stay open in the background.
No problem in gaming, when we user the mobile only for it.
Decent camera. Other mobiles of MI in same range have better camera quality and touch sensitivity.
Excellent batterylife.",3
I bought the phone because of the camera and it is of very poor quality. The pictures are blurred and rear camera is worst. The color of the objects change completely after being clicked. Amazon is not supporting for replacement of the item. No use of having Prime membership. Amazon very bad behaviour from your side. Very dissatisfied from your service and the phone too. Will never buy again from Amazon.,1
i bought samsung M20 4+64GB in August'19. till date this phone has never made me feel happy. the touch has too much of lag. once you have multiple apps open then the phone will hand immediately. the netfilx and amazon prime videos cant be played on this(some compatibility issue). the camera does not render the original colour to photos. the only good thing is the decent battery back-up,2
My phone gets heated up and automatically hangs on by its own. I am facing a terrible issue with this product Samsung Galaxy M20 mobile. Kindly advise on the same.,1
"Always hanging. All apps auto exiting..
Worst packaging. Mobile box seal is not opened. But the scratch guard of the mobile was filled with sand. So it was already used by someone for some days. Worst thing is I paid Rs100 for fast delivery. It's worst.",1
"Look wise product is good, however will rate bad for performance.. response time of finger print reader is bad, oddly placed.. phone takes time to response as become very slow even though it has 3GB RAM.. also charging point has some issue, as stops in between and again need to replugged. Also service centre are not equipped enough to open the phone and they broke the outer ring of finger print sensor.",2
"Fingerpring reader is very smooth n working fast
Rear camera is very nice but front camera and screen flash not good as expected
Battery backup just awesome
Sensor is very bad when u connect to call screen light doesnt off properly thats very bad and other switches pressed by touch of your chik",1
"Bad Quality Phone, even China phone will perform better.
Phone Stop Charging After Just 60 days.
Fraud Service Center wants money for giving quotation. Forget about the issue.
Unfit Build for Mumbai's Climatic Conditions.
Samsung Rep Says Phone is not ""Moisture Proof"" pay for fix.
Unfit Brand for Mumbai's Spirit.
Samsung Galaxy M20 not fit for Mumbai's Hardworking Sweat.",1
"Its a very cheap product, not worth the cost. The speakers of the phone stopped working within two days, when approached the service centre, they refuse to replace the product, they say it can only be repaired and not replaced.
Avoid buying Samsung Products, its cheating.",1
"Based on my six month experience,
main issue with touch calibration. touch malfunctioning with tampered glass. I have tired with 4d and 5d glass.
worst camera. Never relay if u are a photo lover.
Good Display
Good Battery backup (one and half day with full time 4G on)
Sound quality is superb
Face recognition sensor is average. only works in best lights",2
"Worst picture quality from these phone. The portrait mode is not their but an auto Focus mode is their which do not blur properly. And  worst in low lighting. Doesn'tork properly with basic lagging problem. For game lovers this is not a right choice for you. The battery of this phone is nice but still quick charging is not so quick.
You should go for another phone at this price.",1
"Build quality is poor,
Finger biometric scaner takes time to unlock
Face scanner doesn't work some time.

The only thing I like is battery backup is better because of 5000mah.",2
"Malfunction device, i started using it after 15 days as i was not in delhi. After 2 days of usage the phone started malfunctioning, screen blinks and scrolls on its own some times, phone gets hang many times, camera quality is like a VGA camera",1
"Mobile performance is not what I expected according to the description.
Battery drains faster even though it's 5000mah
When I open the phone lock I see many apps are open without my notice.. not satisfied with this",3
I am realy upset with this product samsung value is not acceptable to this m20. I could feel the speaker sound at the back panel. The quality of phone product seems to be so cheap as they want to cut down the price which reflects in quality but at this same price other brands have fentastic high standard quality products. Picture quality is too low which i didnt expect. Other than that phone is good.,1
"SET IS GOOD LOOKING,BUT HEARING/AUDITORY SYSTEM IS VERY BAD. ALSO INTERNET DISCONNECTS FREQUENTLY. I GOT REPAIRED ONCE FROM AUTHORIZED SERVICE CENTER, BUT STILL PROBLEM PERSISTS. VERY DIFFICULT TO LISTEN THE VOICE OF EACH OTHER. AND THERE IS SOME OTHER MORE PROBLEMS LIKE HEATING PROBLEM, SOONER DISCHARGE ETC. MY RATING IS ZERO OUT OF 10. MY ADVISE IS GO WITH ANOTHER MODEL & AVOID M-20.",1
Overall am not satisfied with this mobile..I had spear issue with first  mobile same had been raised and replaced  with new mobile but still am having  same speaker issue in the replaced mobile..I am not recommended to buy this product.,2
"Don't buy phone only to see camera performance. Phone activity performance is most important & this phone is very slow in operation, finger sensor is very slow, dailer screen is very slow & also heating issue.
Over all it is worst phone of samsung. Don't buy.",1
"Horrible always touch issue, screen automatically runs on it's own,  worst issue replaced phone twice but the same issue with both phones, improve touch issue or it'll be a flop model, it's happening with all the m20 users as a technician from Amazon informed me about it",1
"I received this mobile on 27 May 2019 , today when I m writing the review is 1 Nov 2019. Be careful before buy Samsung M 20.
it has been running normally since I got this device but today it got switched off though battery was over 60% . I tried several times to turned it on . It's not showing any charging it is completely dead . Consider it before you buy .",1
"Ordered Samsung M20 mobile through Amazon on 16/7/2019, product was delivered on next day... but this MOBILE is NOT WORKING.
I think you are selling 2nd hand  / Duplicate products.  I went Samsung authorised service centre & showing my mobile, they told me that signal is not catching, mobile mother board will be re pleased.
This is the quality of products selling through AMAZON..........",1
"Had to write this after using the product for more than 2 months....
Biggest disappointment is fast charging...it doesn't work most of the times now and you won't be able to charge it full even in overnight...
Camera is also below average...
After using this I won't trust on any Samsung phone",2
"Received the replaced mobile today. Again received a defective charger, which stops charging all of a sudden. Better refund my amount, I'll buy a mobile at Flipkart which offers best in class service & delivers quality most products without any defects.",1
"After 2 months of use, the phone started restarting during charging. The issue started when I received a call while charging. The phone hung and ringing continued till the service center person switched off the phone by using  hard stop. I was managed to charge the phone  using USB and its went well for somedays. After 2 3 days the restart issue started for USB  charging as well.",1
"Very disappointing product from SAMSUNG. Screen quality not at all like Samsung. Operating OS also not user friendly. Camera is good, battery backup also good. But overall performance not at all satisfactory.",2
"1.Processor is too unhealthy works like 50year old person heart
2.Battery awsome
3.sensors ok
4.lookwise  front side fully ready (back panal looks not ready looks ord need more makup)
5.Very heavy and plz send him to the gym need to get more slimeer",3
Phone is ok not that much satisfied with this.. lot of sensors missing... even there is no option for net speed Status bar. Camara quality is just Ok. Battery is not good as expected..from 5000 mah.,3
"Bad experience. Though the design looks good, phone quality is poor. The display itself is not sticked properly to the phone and is coming out ... wondering what kind of quality check Samsung is doing. As this is already 10 days, found it after this can't return this phone.",3
The phone that I bought has a defect. It takes almost a 6 hours to fully charge  and doesn’t last long at all. I wanted to return it but I don’t have time left to do as I am leaving home. So I am hoping that i can use that warranty card to exchange it.  Till now I bought many electrical appliances but many has defects and I always had to return or exchange it. So I hope this matter gets resolved,3
Worst camera.. selfie camera worst..night mode time photo worst..,1
Looks wise okay ....Samsung it's a brand ....don't  know why I went for dis product ....battery life is very bad n drains out too soon ....I charge it to 100% n once I unplug d charger immediately drops to 99% n in d next 5 mins it is at 93 ...cald customer service multiple times....dey say replace battery ...but its nt covered dis is wat dey say...its nt even a month ...

"I really sad to say, Samsung service is too worst. M20 Phone was blinded slightly. I have contacted service center, they are asking money for repair, I just bought this phone on march 1st, just two months back. Not sure, what is the minimum warranty period.",1
"This a honest review after a week the battery life is great I like it it is a genuine 1.5 day phone if you are not a heavy user the performance is nice but not the best because it does the usual tasks pretty smoothly but while game there is lot of lag. The camera is also nice I really liked the ultra wide in this price point but the details are not the best.
Overall if you are a regular user then it is great but it is not fir heavy gaming",3
"Major problem is Phone hanging. Phone is hanging and nothing is working on display at that time.
next is heating problem. Continuous watching videos or phone usage causing heat problem .
Battery life is not as expected , can get only 1 day battery.
I just bought this mobile just a week ago, facing these many problems. Really we can go for ASUS or Redmi never created any hang or heat problem.",3
Very bad processing and usually hang with lag in doing things. Couldn't expect this bad from Samsung. Call Amazon for return under 10 days return/replacement policy but not have proper response by Amazon technical team .  Wastage of money . Many other good options available in this price category.  No need to go for this option. Probably last time bought any phone from Amazon,1
"This phone even with 4 gb ram hangs like some 5 yrs old Micromax phone.. And mind it, its just 2 days old with no games old heavy app i m using.. Proximity sensor is so freaking non responsive.. I mean wtf is wrong with a brand like Samsung. Battery life far seems good. Sound  of speakers is so low. No basic apps like app lock or galley lock or hide is there.",1
"This phone has lowest sar value its good but in ghat areas where network is poor it cant have network
Wherever i was using my lenovo k8plus it is not getting a singke stick of network lenovo k8plus runs on 4g netwrk there with jio sim but samsung has reduced d network capacity of d phone",2
"Only the display is good in this device infact it is above average and that too at this price range
 , rest is average  rear camera battery, fingerprint scanner .
The worst thing in this phone's front camera it just looks like a VGA camera.
I don't know what has happened to Samsung there cameras used to be awesome even a 5mp one . But this is not acceptable camera performance.",2
"This is the worst product by samsung i was a loyal customer of samsung as i have been using samsung phones from 2013 n every phone of mine was of samsung n i was pretty excited at M series launch but its d worst ever phone till date it hangs every 2-3 mins n often freezes i purchased it on  19 th feb 2019 and sold it for 7000 on march 10 th , 2019 as i was so so tired of it",1
"This phone is not working fine ,i thought to return it but the return window closed.As a prime member I didnt ecpect such a bad quality phone from amazon. kindly do the needful, I need return or refund ,matter of one day delay ,why i have to loose 8000 rs. Kindly consider my case as a genuine one and do the needful",1
 After using this phone for 4 days I got that this product is good for battery backup and if you are selfie lover front camera is average but back camera is good.Amazon was not helping to return as per condition. So be sure before purchasing. Overall average rating. 3 star,3
"Galaxy M series phones: M20 is a phone full with some of the best features a phone could have. This time Samsung has amazed us with such segment of budget phones. For the very first time when i came to know about the price segment of these phones, I was eager to see each and every feature in these phones. I can say, these phones are value for money with the best inbuilt features. Impressed!",1
"I am using this phone since its availble on amazon. I can say that if you want to buy this for camera,you will going to disappoint as its camera is not upto mark. Talking about its fingerprint sensor,it is good but its face recoginition is not upto expectation but if you are looking at looks and battery life then it will provide good battery back up and having attractive look with a notch..",3
"many problem in mobile phone like hanging issue, battery died within 5-6 hours, network issue, touchpad not working properly, totally faulty product by Samsung",1
For given processer and RAM I didn't expect this phone to have laggy UI(may be because of Samsung's customized OS). I never seen any phone this  much laggy around this price range or even 3k or 4k less this. Display is very good and it's main selling point.,2
"The phone is an average fare with average screen . Picture taken are too washed out and some lag . The only saving grace is the battery which last the whole day .
  The android SW require more optimisation , and also the update to pie is scheduled for August 2019 , by which the next version of android will be out.
 Overall and average phone , better alternatives would be Nokia range .",3
"It's the first time I have seen that touch screen is broken but the the front glass isn't even scratched. I had put my phone inside the pocket and when I took it out the touchscreen was chipped at the bottom corner.
To repair the touchscreen I had to shell ₹4500.
Extremely dissatisfied with the purchase.",1
"OK phone in this price range. Gets heated fast if used in sun or outside. Stucks n restarts often. Error messages as "" water detected in charging port"" pops out, unnecessarily annoying very much. RAM n ROM are Ok.",3
"This mobile found one major problem is network issue.
Handsets network capacity is very low.
If your area networks low signals don't bye this mobile or Samsung M Series mobile.",1
"1.This not original samsung brand .
2.Phone is very very hanging.
3.Replacement not working.
4.phone not returnable options.
Please don't buy please don't buy.",1
"This is really not recommended,  only reason is that, its hang too much, even with 2 or 3 apps are opened if... disappointed with this, m scare how i will continue with this phone for atleast another one year, it will make me frustrated..",1
"Phone looks are good but phone doesn't work upto the mark, information mentioned on Amazon about phone is updated only to market the phone, it doesn't match with actual performance of the phone rating given for looks and brand name, my moto g play works far better than Samsung m20",2
"1. Till now the phone looks fine. As the product is only available on Amazon the local markets don't have mobile covers and screen guards. There is a very limited collection available on Amazon.

2. Earphones are not provided with the product. But if you wish to turn on radio you need to plug an earphone. This feature could have been removed or Samsung should have provided earphones.",3
"I'm writing this after 1 month of Mobile usage,  it's really waste of money as the mobile is getting hang within a month and even at that time mobile is working only after switching off and switching on it,  cam clarity is also not that so great.. For these features 10990 Rs.  is very much since we have many good options in other brands.. So don't get cheated by seeing the brand.. Never expected this from Samsung..",1
"Overall good....
Battery life one and half days with full time data on...
While using dial pad... RECENTS not appear
Contact searching in dial pad to be improve .... Give preference from RECENTS..... then from contact list",3
"My phone is brand new  but sorry to say its hung most of the times.  May be phone looks slow n we look faster  .
Camera is stuck most of the times

T",1
"1.started getting stuck in between uses  within 3 days of unboxing
2.camera quality under low light is utter waste.
3.Samsung claims this particular product is having fast charging. I didnt notice anything different from normal charging
4.Box was opened earlier. Product was full of dust.  Seller need to explain this. but product was fresh.",3
"Overall from the front side it's good, picture quality is also good, touch is very responsive not as the old Samsung phones.
Sound quality is very poor,  they are using only Dolby Atoms name not the quality. Sound over bluetooth is very very poor no effect of Dolby and even on any sound setting, thinking to sell it.
Signal reception is quiet poor,  on the same network other phones work well but this one fails.",2
i think for battery & pic phone is good. but for network its not good phone. cus  its show only two tower in all area of Vadodara & net perfomence is also not good. I buy jio sim cus Vodafone card is not working properly but same problem with jio card . I use my jio card in gionee phone its show 4 tower with full speed of net. so Samsung galaxy m20 phone good for long battery life & for pic only not for network.,2
"Kindly get back to me for this. As am unable to have any action against it on app !!
After replacement of my phone ... I have noticed the touch is extremely bad , I am not liking this phone and it’s causing lot of trouble to me . Kindly suggest a resolution for this. It seems to be waste of money for me !",3
"Worst mobile with worst service from amazon,completely waste of money and cheating with customers ,they said that they will provide fast charger but they give a simple charger with mobile and the camera quality is also very bad with bad sound quality . no body will listen to you after purchase the product from amazon even they will not go through your problem .no return ,no exchange .",1
Since I bought it has bad Audio reception. Which both Amazon and Samsung are refusing to attend too. For the price an amazing phone. With good camera. But the incoming and out going audio will leave you baffled. And fighting Samsung to rectify it.,1
Front speaker is not working so I don't happy this product please tell me solution,3
"Battery is 5000 MAH but it drains a lil fast making me feel like it's a 4000MAH.
Camera quality is very good. Phone is quite heavy weight. After using it for only more than 2 months, it's touch sensors are not just perfect and troublesome.
No facility is provided for screen wake up without pressing the side key.",3
"Speakers and mic is not that much audible. Listener couldn't hear my voice even I have full volume.. someway  when I play music, its sound is not that much audible even I put volume in full..

Battery is excellent. Camera is nice. Finger print and face recognition are good.

I m using this mobile for 2 months. So far good except mic and speakers.",3
"Not expected this from a brand like Samsung. The performance is just so poor. Sometimes, the phone automatically turns into a dead machine. The Face Recognition and the Fingerprint sensor are not much responsive. Others brands offer much more features at this price range.",1
"After just 3 months of usage battery has been draining very quickly and at the same time it is taking more time to get recharged.
No quality accessories available for this phone.
This phone is not available for exchange offers on any of the e-commerce sites.
Within 1 month of purchasing this M20
Price got dropped from 13 k to 12k.
Overall not worth 12 or 13K",1
"Hi guys I have bought this device in first sale. But I have received defective handset with battery problem and network problem. Then I have received replacement from Amazon, but again I have face Network issue, In this brand device M20 having such a network issue.",1
"Not looks like a Samsung phones it feels like other local brad China phone like Oppo Vivo Redmi Mi phone
Camera quality is  also not so good I can say average quality
Look is good but again built quality is not so good
Battery is 5000 mah but it's seems like 4000 mah
Screen quality is also not so good its average like other phone",3
THE MOBILE AUTOMATICALLY SWITCHING TO OFF MODE WHILE CHARGING. IT IS MENTIONED AS FAST CHARGING BUT IT IS NOT SO. IT TAKES MINIMUM 5 HOURS TO FULL CHARGE.,1
"picture quality is good ,sound is not so good, I disappointed by battery, camera and touch. Battery is not working as they are showing  5000 mah .photo quality  of both cameras  is very poor and some times touch not respond after even 3 or 4 touch .it not like I was expecting. Samsung  traying to come back but with such phone they will never come back.",1
"I have 2 Samsung M Series phones
M20 and M40
Both are useless and waste of money
Biggest issues are:
Over heating while Video Call or Recording
Lagging everytime u use
Not at all smooth touch
4G not available on foreign sims
I was in US and regretting for buying this crap instead of MI

Pros
Only Brand Name for your personality",1
This phone is ok but having hanging issue and heating issue while browsing but that test application showing everything is perfect in the phone but I have facing the same issue and some times I unable to pick phone calls whenever incoming calls coming on that time also phone getting hang while charging also phone getting overheating.,2
This phone keeps crashing. It seems that the vendor is selling phones that are refurbished. Also when the phine was delivered I was assured that the phone will work abroad but it did not work recently on a trip to Hong Kong with a local SIM card. Waste of money . The only option will be to jailbreak and put another Android version and thus I will lose my warranty.,1
In 2 months of use the screen got damaged and service centre didn't fix it saying it water damage. There was no water to be found inside. They showed some white marks on the mother board and concluded that it could be due to water. Service engineer also says that while talking some sweat might have entered the device. Never buying a Samsung again.,2
"After 20 days of use, nothing extraordinary about the 5000mah battery. It just last a day and drains like any other phone even when idle.
Speaker volume is poor as it had just one speaker compared to redmi. Frequent signal issues. Overall spend few couple of thousands more and get a redmi.",2
Like the design but performance is not good. It hangs actually.sometimes touch isn't working. For normal usage itself it hangs and phone gets extreme over heat some time. I don't know what will happen to this mobile if play games and multiple using. Sorry to say this but this is true. NOT WORTHY,3
"I didn't expect a Samsung phone of this rate to hang!! This was a biggest shocker to me. Camera clarity is inferior to a budget phone under the 10k segment. I'm not able to return this nor use this product fully. Touch suddenly responding to worsen the existing problems. Battery, fast charging and weight are its pros, to name a few.",1
Initial impressions were really good. But as day passed the cheapness of the product was discovered. The finger print reader is the most stupid thing I had to struggle. The side edges are more prone to accidental touches. Probably need a software upgrade.,2
"This product is too fragile and vulnerable.In M20 No display protection like gorilla glass. Samsung made a great downgrade quality compromise, while 'try' to maintain the price low, but in a realistic manner the price is completely waste of money.
Even after sales service is too expensive and very bad.It slip from my hand from 2feet and result is the image. Too much fragile.",1
"Screen is very weak..
My phone fell once from bed and screen cracked from corner even after using a cover and tempered glass..
Specification wise this phone is good but samsung should have provided a good quality screen..
According to Reviews this phone has dragonglass but i dont think so.. it has a normal glass used in phones earlier that could break too easily..",1
"Good ph, amazing battery backup.
But I am facing signal issue with this handset.
I thought that may be due to poor network. But when i used the same sim in my other handset, signals are coming properly.
Kindly hep me to resolve the signal issue.",3
"Very bad, every one can open just little security. Camera quality is good, battery life is very good, can use one day with full working...
However, phone is not recommend,always hang  problem without any mean, some time mobile lock keyboard is totally untouchable, just like I am using 6 month old phone,  I purchased this mobile before 15 days...",2
"I dislikes it. It is very bad product ever in samsung.
I have not expected it. It feels to me it has done  cheat with me.
I request you all to the costumer plz dont buy this product and waste your money.
This is worst product. It has no battery backup which have shown us.
It looks very well but it does not work properly. Touch of this mobile is also bad.
I am reliable to buy this product.",1
"It takes minimum 7 hours to full charge
They don't give 15v charger not fast charging
No 1.2mtr data cable
I just wasted my money and after complaining  they don't replace  or give any help

Amazone  and Samsung  they are froud",1
"I am.not happy with the screen.  Its too sensitive.  It just fell from knee length height and the screen is broken jnto pieces within 2 weeks.
When i contacted the Samsung store they are neither replacing it nor giving any sort of concession.  I have been using samsung like forever. This is the most horrible experience i ever had.

Else the phone is good to use.",2
"Fingerprint scanner: Not at all responsive, responds after multiple attempts.
Touchscreen: i bought this product last week and i am using it with a broken touch now, it was so delicate that it couldn't even withstand one fall, i slipped my phone accidentally and now i am living with a broken touch, i have used a lot of phones in my life but this one is the worst for sure.",1
Frequent call drops for both incoming and outgoing. Samsung service center at Chennai blaming service provider BSNL and refused to register a complaint. I never faced this problem with any of my earlier phones with BSNL.,1
"Phone speaker sound is less,and memorycard slot is not working ,and remaining all are very good, battery is good,back camera is working is satisfactory,but the front camera is little clarity missing.",3
"Battery: Got the phone for the 5000 mAh battery. Battery backup is average still. Can Last for a  days usage, but will need a charge by evening/night. For comparison, I also have a Motorola One Power device with similar 5000 mAh battery which easily lasts a couple of days on a single charge.
Camera: Average
Screen: Very good. AMOLED would have been the cherry on top",3
"Battery is feel like 4000 mah,front camera waste,after every call recording call pop up msg killing. Some time text won't type in WhatsApp for getting lock. No hear phone and otg cable. Some times slow Network. Expectations not satisfied.",2
This product is a total rubbish and the services of samsung is also rubbish. My phone's display is giving problems and they are asking for 4500 Rs. to repair it(the phone is under warranty period). Total rubbish phone. Total waste of money.,1
"The phone is good but my device was working fine until i got an update ,after installing the update the phone became like it has some mental issues ,its touch stopped working,phone started to talkback, and all this happend while i was on vacation with my family. Anyways lets see what samsung has to provide me with thier services",3
Samsung  mobile was my favourite  brand but my faith break down after purchase  m20.its camera are very low quality  and battery  backup are very poor.drain in 3 to 4 hrs like water.i was use Samsung  mobile  since 10 yrs but further i never use this brand.,1
Very heavy and laggy. Samsung trying to play catch up with companies that are good at manufacturing premium quality economic to mid-range phones and failing.,1
"This is very average product not better then others mobile in same category.
Battery claim of 5000 mg is not true it drains fast and last less than 14 hours in single recharge.,after 2 hour  of call in day with limited app such WhatsApp,couple banking app,no FB ,LinkedIn, Twitter and few more app, also keeping hotspot on continuously on throughout day.",2
"The phone has many good features like fast charging,etc but it hangs.Its really irritating to see a new phone hanging so frequently..
Touch screen is also not good...",1
"Very slow phone. Pathetic. Tried multiple things to make it fast. Painful. Keeps on downloading for eternity. Frustrating. Don't go for it. Had been using note 4. Compared to that, it's nothing. Thinking why didn't I go for note 7 pro..",1
"Remaining All things processor of phone too slow, which been showing when you will use multiple application most of times mobile got hangged. Now days there is lots of heating in phone. Multiple times tried to resolve this issue fron customer care, but they always denied just trusting on Blancoo app which is showing fake results.",1
"Screen size is not good width is not good enough,
Finger print sensor is not working properly,
I'm facing technical issues like... not showing phone inbuilt ringtones.. neither I am able to change ringtones,
Ringtone sound is very low,
And once you buy ....u can get ur phone replace by Amazon....no refund will be given...words as per Amazon customer care",1
Worst camera quality..unexpected from Samsung...photo captured at high resolution and bright sunny light even gives you blur effect...I have always used low budget phone and not very ambitous about camera quality...but this one really frustrated me...absolute shocking from Samsung...Battery hardly lasts for one day orveven less on average usage..5000 mah is really funny...,1
"Jio range reception too bad
Poor camera
No option to screen mirror
Not mhl suported
Heavy
Ok face recognition
Good battery life
Slow data speed when both sim slots used
Fingerprint reader not dat great",3
The worst mobile phone..... Getting hanged lot of times ... Pubg not workkng fine as expected of 4gb ram.... Battery backup the good thing only.....  If you are okay with basic use then go for it.... Otherwise its really not worth of money and performance ..... Otherwise i can rate 3/10,1
"Nice display ...great battery fast charging ..Good call quality and average back camera
selfie is not up to the mark very disappointed with the front camera
no earphones no back cover no screen protection all U have to buy from outside.
earphones should be at least provided with the box.
I will rate the phone 7 out of 10",3
"Impressed with the design, After a series of struggle to purchase it on Flash sale...wooh i made it I got it...was happy initially😊...After couple of days usage found this product is useless and worth not buying it..Mobile started Hanging oftenly and Poor camera quality...I want  to sell this....OLX or Quick are guys here? Please buy it...",1
"Hi friends, Dont buy Samsung m20 series mobiles. I have been using 2 months this phone.
1) Main problem is over heating even in normal usage as well as charging.
2)Battery back up also not upto the level and not even crossed 10 hours. Need to charge again.
3) Phone is overweight. After 15 min your hand will get more pain.

So think before you buy.",2
"My advice is go for M20, it's allrounder. I used M20 for 4Months before but now I use A30. Now I feel M20 is much better than A30, bcz M20 battery, 4G cellular signal strength, sound for incoming and outgoing calls, wide angle camera shots, video and audio quality for film watching, easy for Android Oreo with samsung experience 9.5 , and fast battery charging.
better to buy M20 Samsung 64GB model (blue Color).",1
"After a long wait, I received this mobile. On the first sight the overall look was excellent. Once I started to use it, everything turned upside down.

Wait for Redmi Note 7, if you are looking for a best mid-range smartphone in this price segment.",3
Since we have bought this phone every call gets disconnected after 10-20 seconds. It starts with a sound like flowing water and after 2 seconds the call is disconnected. Using airtel sim in slot 1. This problem is faced on my spouse's galaxy s8 as well however on that phone it is rare and on this phone it is extremely frequent  on every call. Trying to figure out a solution not yet successful.,2
Extreme overheating problem. Can't even use the internet while on a call. I didn't find anywhere being mentioned in any of the reviews about this internet issue. Camwra is average. Overall below average performance. I regret buying it now.,2
"I bought this phone last month but i don't know how the touch keeps glitching, I think it's a problem with the touch panel, I also went to the Samsung care center and told them but they said it needs update and even after that it keeps glitching, don't buy this phone!",1
"Overall a good phone. But it's water sensitive. This product cannot handle water like other basic mobiles in the market. I am facing charging issues amd display problems due to accidentally getting it wet during a rainy day. However in my opinion, the exposure was not of a magnitude for me to be facing such severe issues.
I am now taking it up with the manufacturer.",3
Its been 3 months and it already started lagging and getting stuck while closing app or opening new app. Though all the updates are done but the problem still persists. Battery life is great but what will you do with the battery when your phones keeps getting hang while operating. Sim1  not working properly. Phone keeps getting heated up while charging and while talking.,1
Camera quality of the phone is ridiculous. In low light your clicked picture from m20 will recall u pics clicked by ur 1 mp phones 5-6 years back. Otherwise phone is good in this price range. I will not recommend this phone to anybody,1
"It was very bad experience with product as well as Amazon's service.

Product not working properly again n again need to format as its camera not working properly hanging again n again.

N when go for return they send one app n link for diagnosis. As i purchased Mobile for my brother so unable to run the app in his mobile. N Amazon not taking return.",1
Worst phone from Samsung I trusted brand and got it very useless phone brought 4gb ram mobile but available only 1.6gb free camera worst front cam is like vga camera is better than that they are cheating people by saying it has 8mp 13mp camera after we just ask camera is not good they will reply nothing can do from our side so please friends don't buy this only for battery you can go with it,1
"No led indicators.-
1. If you are charging  your phone then no led lights are blinking.
2. No led for any notifications  like miss call or msg.

Fingerprint sensor is something  not working  properly.

Scroll down option is also not working something  properly.
Camera  is also average.

Not worth buying  in approx 13000.
Its seems like 8000 rupees  phone.",3
The features don't mention that only an indian sim can be used in this phone. I am returning it as I have to use an international sim in it. Everything should be mentioned in the features.wastage of time and money.,1
"good looking but performance is worse, heating problem and also hanging and face recognition is lol very worse ...amd once you purchase Amazon is not talking any responsibility and also and Samsung is telling you don't purchase with us so talk with amazon.... hahaha and amazon don't pay back so you don't have option to buy another phone so choose carefully... thank you",1

"Worst camera. Plastic body cheap. Good only on paper. Performance is worst. Hang and Lag issues r there
 Low Performance as compared to  Snapdragon 636. Screen is ok ok. Doesn't look like Samsung phone. PUBG frame drop issue. Not very smooth gameplay.",1
Phone is heating to much.  New one brought and just installed wahtsup and Facebook it is heating...  Very hard to keep near ear and talk.

Samsung makeing people's foolish. Waste of money . This phone only working in India . It's not global version.plz donot waste your money. Amazon and Samsung jointly making foolish peoples both jointly selling menufacturing defect phone in India.,2
"My M20 was delivered on !st August. That time i was out of station in ahilly area. When i reached back my home i saw the product, its display was cracked. although display is working fine, but hair line crack on display is disappointing. What should i do, please help me positively. An early rep;y from your side is awaited.",2
"No doubt, Phone works amazing but I am suffering from 'N' numbers of problem. The ghost touch, the non charging Battery. The company gives us the fast charger facility still phone is unable to charge 100% after 7hrs of plugin.
The phone got unique camera, for day light its amazing but as soon as the light dims out, the M20 shows its patchy photo.",3
Don’t buy this product. battery is not lasting even 1 day. when i ask samsung customer care they said you turn off mobile data and delete all apps then only you will get charge more than 1 day. No one will use phone without mobile data and deleting all apps. Face recognisation is very slow. when you phone very urgent to use face recognisation will not work. you have to use pattern.,1

"Battery backup is good. Fast Charging is also very good. But it has Heating issues. While playing PUBG, it become very hot. Volume is less(for Multimedia contents). Simply will be getting notification alert without anything on screen, software update might fix the problem.",3
"Camera interface is poor it changes automatically between wide angle lens and main lens, sometimes camera lags when taking photos , image quality is not upto mark,if you like to take good images with less digital noise i would suggest consider another phone for camera, but asthetically looking good and have good battery life",3
"Touch screen is not at par, as compared to its counterpart Xiaomi,
Camera quality is average,
Sim tray is not adjusting my Samsung 32 GB memory card.
I prefer only to less dependent on Xiaomi, but disappointed.
Same configurations available in 9000 bucks also.",2
"""Absolutely rubbish""...this is the one truth about this phone . Samsung is fooling everyone with its own made processer super slow phone after using 2 month i can't even pick a call it's hanging....can u imagine....apart from its battery,(camera os) super flop i am not sure about other model of samsung but  i am totally ditched by samsung...this is nothing but truth",1
"Main function of mobile phone is to listen to calls..I am not able to hear anything...voice quality is very poor since day one..Amazons replacement policy is pathetic, you have to install an app which submit a report..this blanco app has a rating of 2..Amazon don't do this with your trusted buyers..I have asked for any return or replacement before",1
"Guy don’t loose your sentiments on Flash sale/Samsung

I have been using the phone for a week now and i can tell you that it’s camera is an ordinary, also 5000 battery has no presence in its own. Think twice before you buy. Also, post sale there is no feedback option so that you can convey things right in time.
I give 3 STARS to this phone.",3
"Do not but any product on Amazon. Their incapable of solving any issue that may arise.

If you are looking for a phone for media consumption, light gaming and day to day usage this is it. Samsung makes world class displays and One UI is way better than the Chinese options. Heat is quite noticeable. Front camera sucks and rear camera is ok.",1
"Don't expect too much from phone.
Fingerprint sensor is not as sensitive.
Camera is like same as it comes in typical cheap samsung phone.
Although battery life is better.
PVC build body, can be broken easily

PUBG lags
Overheating

But if you are a Samsung fan then in this budget. Else go for MI or Realme",3
"I have very bitter experience about M20 my phone twice called upon at local service center n thrice emailed Samsung support but failed to get my problem which are many solved.  I am fade up n thinkig to go for legal action in consumer court. Please think twice before purchase.  Pleaseeeeee help me in solving my phone problems.

"Features in Samsung Galaxy M20 is not much then what expected....  Finger print sensing time is very very poor, it takes a lot of seconds to read and to access,  More importantly,  software updates quite often steals away the in-build memory space....

"I have replaced my induction stove with this. Even when we use for normal calls, or browsing, or view some videos on Youtube device is heating up.

"I made a big mistake by choosing this mobile device as I am facing hell lot of problems using it from past 2 weeks. Its not worth at all. Screen flickering, hanging while using smaller applications and many more if I describe in detail. Simply I can say that this phone is not tested properly and released to the market.",1
"Don't buy
Got this in 8099/- on 25 Jan 020.
Phone is ok but it may b a defective product takes 10-20 seconds in unlocking the screen (when remains black for upto 20 second when you press power button or fingerprint scanner). Battery backup is also not like 5000 mah type. Older huawei p20 lite with 3000 mah battery lasts longer than this.
Don't buy.",1

Battery is ok..not as it should be for 5000 mah. Sound is average not very high. Headphone Jack is near the charging point but  it should have been on the top of the phone. Picture quality is decent. Overall a decent phone at this price.,3

Worst smartphone i have ever used in my life. Heavy network issue. It is not only my device but all the Samsung M20 devices are facing this big proble.

Buy a Redmi or Motorola instead.",1

The phone is not up to the expectations set by it's advt & reviews. The phone lags pretty much & is slow even for a light user. My father is using it so you can assume how heavy or light user he could be. Camera & fingerprint rdrs are ok but battery life is not as xpctd as being 5000 mah .,3

Battery is really ossom 4 days without charging works.

The camera performance is very very poor and never expected this kind of low quality for 12K bucks. Also the phone performance is also not as expected.

Battery life draining out too fast on this phone. On standby this phones drains out 15% of phone battery with just single Sim card. I also use and old MI 3s prime which only looses 4% battery on double sim in the same time.  Charging time with the given charger is 2.5 hours which is too long. Ultimately this phone is a bad chose. The 5000MPH battery actually works like a 3000MPH battery.,1

"Camera quality is worst, it give blur images. Battery life is average not like 5000mah. Fingerprint sensor doesn't recognize sometimes. Face lock is also having problems. After using an 2 month phone get hanged and it also get heated while charging or talking. I personally recommend please don't buy it, it's all wastage of money. Better go for REDMI NOTE 7 PRO",3
"In 2014 I used a Samsung phone but due to the hanging problem. I purchased MI Phone This phone was awesome.

The worst phone I ever bought at Amazon. Please whoever suffering of hanging and freezing issue visit authorised service centre and keep roam for 2to3 times I bet problem won’t be rectified then call Samsung customer service and ask for refund. After 10 days they definitely issue refund. This is my experience.,1
"Does not feel its 5000 mh battery, backup is not good.

Considering 10000 price , its not as per expectation.",3
I have received damaged product.. I need a replacement immediately,2

This is the worst phone of samsung brand. I have never seen  of samsung brandthe front camera is the like nothing(picture quality is too bad). Back camera is also not up to the expectations.

"Phone worked fine for first 3-4 days but then it started facing sensor issues.
Finger print sensor stopped working, proximity sensor was also having issues.
Otherwise phone was working good.

Touch & Feel- Good
Phone speed- Average",2

this is disturbing situation for me i want use camera and camera will respond when i will lock and unlock the phone.

Dear Amazon,

i want solution for this problem.",3
"Screen shattered from a minor 2 feet drop. I am sure there is no screen protection given as claimed by Samsung. Will never ever buy Samsung phone again in my whole life.
People thinking of buying Samsung should think twice.",1
"recently bought samsung m 20 mobile from amazon has some screen defective issues (screen is getting automatically blinking and shaking frequently ) replacement date has gone ,when i webt to service center he told to open the mobile parts , but samsung is not able to replace the product as how we new buyers of samsung believe its value and its product quality @samungindia",1
The only good thing about this phone is its battery. The fingerprint scanner needs 2 touches arleast. User interface is bad. After latest update the phone hangs a lot even for just  going through the menu. I should have gone for MI instead. If u want battery life only on the cost of everything else. Go for it.,2
It did not reach my expectation although its price was just above my budget. So I would like to get a replacement of another Samsung m20 or Samsung m30. I am also ready to pay for the extra charges for m30. It is not user friendly too. So please consider my request. I m also a regular customer for Amazon.. Hope u consider my request.,2
"Although, the phone performance is good, I am surprised to see the phone have no regular features like Scheduled power on off, option for placing important contacts on home screen, etc. It is embarassing to see the phone asks to draw the security pattern after thumb unlock.",1
"Have been using this phone for a feq months and I have only complaints. Very slow fingerprint reader. Terrible battery management.
Samsung has made its worst phone yet. I would not recommend this useless phone to anyone. Extremely disappointed and annoyed with is phone's performance.
Please do not buy this phone, it is a complete waste of money.",1
5000 battery charging  taking more than 2 hours draining very fast.max 6 hours u can use mobile .processor speed also less compare to others .. performance  low..heating  while gaming or using more time..HANGING frequently .. apps hiding security also not good ...better to don't but don't cry ....its my opinion  after using so many days,1
"Battery backup and fast charging also network issue and Google camera is not working properly,  and other phone pic is not adjusting in this phone and app(f.b,WhatsApp  profile pic) also pixel are breaking if WhatsApp profile pic will add by same phone and know M30 will be same",1
"The best thing about this phone is battery it has 5000 mah battery that runs 2 day easily, Mobile screen is very good resolution is good it has water knotch display good for watching videos and play games. what is missing in this phone is camera quality, camera is not as good as other phone in this segment.",3
Battery life is very poor. If morning 6am 100% at 6pm it will be 15% without see movie or YouTube . No first charging facilities. To full charge it will take 5hours.  Overall a poor facility mobile . I had bought on last week. I am not recommend anyone to buy this product.,1
"So this is my new after month and half
Pros
1 battery life is good
2 screen display is good
Cons
My screen display just went blank without any fall or damage .. the service center fixed within a day but still couldn't get the reason
Phone hangs for games like pubg
Camera quality is not that good . The colour are dull",1
"firstly the ram provided in this phone is 3GB, out of which 2 GB is already used and left with 1GB only.
if you update your phone, then it uses more of your RAM. The phone gets really very slow. It cant be used at all..!! not worth the money for me, when so many better phones are available.",1
"Very bad mobile lost of money
This my first Samsung experience
Camera not good
Display black color video is not exact black
Team Samsung you're most trusted brand like iPhones please don't release this types of mobiles
Battery is good, sound is good, screen is big
But i am not happy with this hope yours next update will change everything....",2
"I am using this phone for more than 1 month now and the pros and cons are as below.

Pros:
1. Good Battery life
2. Display & visibility is good
3. Fast charging

Cons:
1. Heavy weight
2. Bulky
3. Finger unlock is not up to the mark. Many a times needs to press multiple times to unlock",3
It's not at all what I expected...too slow performance..its getting stucked at one process itself not even getting switched off also after that...charging issues getting heated up lot ...facing these all issues after 1 week of purchase...,2
"No matter how it's camera or battery or fingerprint reader works when the phone's processor is not working properly. Very bad experience. Internet access very slow, hanged time to time, some apps could not working properly i.e Daily hunt, pdf viewer etc. No one could be suggested to buy any repeat any Samsung product now a day. Full wastage of money.",1
"1. 3GB is not enought. Its slow
2. Back camera is good. Selfie camera is below average
3. Display is awesome.
4. Battery is awesome. Runs for almost 2days.
5. Fingerprint reader is worst. Doesn't work all the time.",3
"No fast charger and charging taking around 4-5 hours, fast battry consuming even in 1 hour 20 percent battary down for just updated the application, screen brightness is very low even in night dark, heated in just 10-15 minutes, heavy wait and big size not easy to carry in pocket. Conclusion is wastage of money.",1
"i have check first charging and heating issue , any application and gaming very very highly heated , and charging to take time mostly not good ,9.25 am start charge to 31% and 10.30 am 39%10.51-55%11.01-62%11.32-73% 11.47-87%

I bought it this mobile for my father. With in 3 months it’s start hanging. Unable to take pictures and unable to use other functions also. Very disappointed with Samsung.,1
"I am writing  review after 1 week started using phone.

My phone got off automatically  and I visited service center l, they said there is some problem with motherboard  they will get replace.

Here a question of reliability
A question of Trust?",1
"Battery is good, best in this price range, almost has every basic need, don't know about gaming, camera not soo good, overall descent buy. Being samsung brand fan like it despite sometimes touch goes out of control as screen zooms in n out itself but after lock n unlock it's fine, didn't even install too many apps or big games. But good battery n don't worry about display quality, its good.",3
"Net connectivity will take you to era of 2G mobiles, touch sensitivity will surprise you that how the app is opened when I have not even touched the screen.Call drop is as common as you breath due to low signal level (by the way I live 500 mtrs from Voda tower).

Now up to you if you want to feel blessed as I feel post buying this phone.",1
"1. Worst camera
2. Samsung Secure and health applications are not supported.
3. Charcoal Black colour is not Black it's dark blue.
4. It has 3x charger but it tooks more than 2 hours to charge the mobile.",2
Phone is very bed after 2 month my phone dead . and change mother bord and buttery. And next 1 day my phone dead again the service center tell me update binary software but not change my phone . my new phone open in 3 times Customer service is very bad response so plz not purchased this phone,1
"Dont buy this phone! There is either a problem in software by default or a virus/malware built in or it is highly prone to hacking, my phone (when connected to internet) starts apps on its own, writes messages on its own, touch stops working.

Edit: there was faulty motherboard and screen, changed at service center, working fine for now.",1
"Very very poor network reception,no range anywhere..Phone shows 4g in very few areas where all other phone with same ssim card shows better network.Phone gets stuck always as show in picture.Formatted phone many times but no uchange.Less rate is just a fake attraction..Never buy this,breaks very easily unlike redmi or realme
most pieces are defective",1
"The primary camera is not good. And the face recognition is too slow that most of the times, u will end up putting in pin instead of waiting for the device to read your face. Also, bring a Samsung device, it shows too many ads. Overall, quality is fine, but competitors like Xiaomi are providing a better end product in the similar price range.",3
"Bought this phone with high expectations as i was never a Samsung user and was expecting better after seeing this M series as a budgeted second phone in pocket. But its not worth. Ghost touch issue, speaker issue, lags while operating and. Will not recommend.",2
There is a dent on the cellphone set of Samsung  m20 and the senior of tecnition are taking it lightli even after complain to Amazon service centre and and tecnition who visited to home for inspection ....they r not ready to replace .....This is very very bad,1
THIS NEW MARKET EXPERIMENT BY SAMSUNG TO TAKE ON THE CHINESE BRANDS IS NOT UP TO THE MARK. IT GETS STUCK OFTEN AND YOU WILL HAVE TO REBOOT IT EVERY DAY EVEN MULTIPLE TIMES IN A DAY. A RUSHED PRODUCT.,1
"Ghatia phone he. Wasted my 13000. I should have bought some other phone.
Tried to contact Samsung. They asking me to sell the phone in exchange to buy an upgraded phone.
Pathetic!!!",1
"iam a regular user of samsung phones. Used samsung note 3 neo for the past 4 years. Loved its quality . but disappointed with M20. i dont even remember dropping the phone. accidently may be placed some weight on it but i am for sure i had not handled it rough. Within a month display fully gone. Since its new, claimed the warranty.",2
"I have bought this phone almost a month back. This phone has not worked even for a day. This shows the problem ""not registered on network"". I tried everything but it did not work. I have shown this at samsung service centre also but they also could not fix it. Please do not buy this phone at all. This network issue is Major issue.",1
"Dear Amazon..
your policy and samsung policy is not synchronize .You are giving replacement for 10 days only while samsung is giving for 14 days .as in my case i activated my phone on 19 sept after usage of 1 hour my phone is dead. Now the problem is samsung is not giving any replacement to me what will i do.Should i move to consumer forum?",1
Disappointed. I bought this phone just before 8-10 days but suddenly charging issue come up when we reach service center they said charger is not working but I need to give them mobile for 3 days.  Why should I give them mobile for charger repairing. After this suddenly incoming/outgoing call voice gone I need to use speaker all the time to talk,1
This product has a manufacturing defect. Softwares are not getting downloaded from Google Play Store. Amazon has no policy to return money once you purchase mobile from their website. It is recommended not to buy any Samsung Product and also not from Amazon. I am totally dissatisfied with SAMSUNG & AMAZON. Both have cheated me. My No.98300 33890,1
Please DO NOT BUY M2O has very high heating and hanging issues and sometimes screen is also not respond when you unlock phone or in case if incoming calls screen is completely stuck and it needs to unlock again to work properly Very Bad product And also VERY BAD CUSTOMER CARE AND AFTER SALES SERVICE. This was not expected from Samsung but it's TRUE Plz Do not buy M20.,1
The phone looks good..initially I liked it very much. After using 10days sometimes the screen starts moving without any operation. I would like to return but replacement policy expired. They have given replacement policy only for 10 days. Camera quality not that great.,1
performance of this mobile set is not up to mark as per 4 GB MI performance. no value for money. the same price other best option are available. using with multiple app it very slow even screen touch is not good as i expected. due to 10 days return policy it has gone.,1
"Ordered black received blue
Mobile  hangouts frequently
Picture quality  very  poor
Trying  hard to return the mobile.  But Amazon  people  are claiming that there is no return  policy

Would like to give below  one  star, unfortunately  one star is the low rating.

"After using 2 week I found these points-
1. Finger print sensor too much delay
2. Battery is average, don't expect too much considering 5000 mah battery

Tottaly disappointed with this phone..I was a samsung fan and after using this phone realise i was wrong. Samsung lost its build quality and standards. This phones performance is very poor in all aspects.camera i feel like an old vga cam.,1

I don't recommend to buy this phone.",2
"It's been just over a month since I made the purchase. It's a fairly basic phone I'd say.. camera is average, battery life is unsatisfactory, screen does get unresponsive (u need to press hard sometimes), looks are Just perfect. You can buy it if u need a phone for basic everyday usage.. consideration price its not a bad phone.",3
"This phone is not good.
I ordered this mobile 5 feb. So I using phone since purchased, this phone is not good.

It has battery problem, charger problem and my phone M20 suddenly phone suddenly on.
Battery is not charging.
I done big mistake to purchase Samsung M20.
Shame on samsung co.",1
Overall the phone is okayish. I feel 3 GB memory is not enough and the phone has lags  while normal operation. It is kind of slow in operation. The best thing is the battery. It lasts for 2 days with regular use. Camera is okayish. I'll suggest to go for A30 if you have budget or at least the 4 GB version of M20.,3
"I have not used finger print reader.
Battery life and camera quality is good.
Mobile not working properly.
Often goes to sleeping mode. On off switches not working.
Mobile working during 1) on receipt of phone call 2) after connecting charger
turned into sleeping mode within 30 seconds and on off switches not working",2
"It's been just 2 months that I purchased this phone from Amazon and the touch is terrible. It's not at all smooth and the face unlock doesn't respond at times. The fingerprint of this phone basically sucks it just doesn't captures the fingerprint properly. So, at the end I have to unlock my phone with the phone pattern or the password codes.",2
I am very disappointed with this phone poor quality of material were used. After four months purchased screen black dot are visible and screen not wording. No physical were damaged. After going service center thay asking 6000  ruppes for repair. Very poor quality and waste of money on Samsung mobile,1
First phone I got was defective one...second one was working for last three months...and it's finger print sensor is not working any more..sooooo poooor quality gadget by SAMSUNG...I never thought samsung will be that category like other china brands!!!!,1
"Pros - Looks

Cons - It took 5 hrs. To recharge 70%...Fast charge???

Overall Not a Best Buy",1
"Photos are worst,
Battery is okay not that great as what I expected from 5000mah
Phone that I have is bit slow and get hanged frequently wanted to replace it but cannot due to policy",2
"The  service  provided  by  samsung  is  not  good  as they  gave  the  OS  update in  which  the  updated from android oreo 8.1  to  pie 9
The  fault  is  that  they  have  redused the multi windo app  system
The  main  purpus  for  me  to  buy  this  phone  was to use  multi app  at  same  the  but  now  it  is  of  no  use  for  me  very  bad",1
It's hard to believe that company like Samsung will have that much issue with battery life. I selected this handset only because there is a battery of 5000 mah but it's just for showcasing but reality is it lasts only a day and drains too early like a 2-3 yrs used phone which is very disappointing.,3
"The battery backup is good but fingerprint sensor nd camera is worst. And the screen doesn't works properly and works very slowly. Can't hear the voice clearly while talking, sometimes silent!!! When the phone is locked sometimes it shows the home screen when push the on off button and again try to start it remains the same!!! Worst phone.",3
"Don't buy this phone.
Never expect that Samsung cheating first time to customers.",1
"Beauty is skin deep......lot of ads pop up on the home screen which is very irritating n u cannot deactivate also, earpiece sound is difficult to hear due to high sharpness otherwise it is ok ok for the price",3
Both front and back camera poor. Touch not working many attempts. Poor return police.  I tried to return the product but it asked me to go some app for filling return the product.,3
As usual samsung thing..bought for my father as they believe in big named companies but after 1 month only started showing its colour..the phone hangs and freezes sometime the camera app just dont open and when it does it shows black screen with capture button only..worst phone dont buy it please.,1
"Internet works  very slow by unknown reason  and RAM speed is not that  good..

"Disappiointed by Camera clarity. So much lags even isang without use one apps like FB, Twitter, Instagram as well as Tokyo.. over all it looks good to have this cell.. but if you want performance then I would recommend you try other one.. don't go for this.. btw the delivery agent was so rude if you're planning to order it from Bhiwandi.",3
It's not good.....don't buy this phone... Hanging and heating problem... Touch pad also not good.. I returned... Thanks to Amazon easily return,2

-Unlocking slow many times problematic.
-Auto brightness doesn't function properly.",3
"The face recognition is not very responsive, especially in low light. Sometimes it refuses to recognize. The image stabilization is not good at all. But non of that matters/bothers me as much as the fact that the screen will randomly fidget/twitch like a software glitch out of nowhere. There are times that the touch stops performing unless one locks and unlocks the phone.",3
"Ekdam faltu mobile hai useless pls don't buy this products network problem ,software problema very slow performance ,and second thig is jab Maine refund karne k liye request ki ro amazon wale refund karne k liye mana kar rahe very bad platform amazon  dont go on Amazon platform ,kisi flipcart se buy karo but Amazon se kabhi nhi buy karo",1
"This phone has only one issue which makes it a bad option.

"The M20 ocean blue phone with 3 GB ram + 32 gb was purchased in the month of may,19 and the display has been blacked out in the month of June,19. This phone had such good reviews but it hardly worked for a month and the display went off without the phone falling down or any other reason. just out of the blue moon the display went off.",1
"It's an honest review, I have been using M20 3GB version since a week and there are no issues as such. It's a budget phone for the features like - bigger screen with notch, face unlock, selfie camera features.
Only issue I feel that it's get heated while in fast charging mode.
All in all it doesn't disappoint you in this budget range. First time buyers can surely go for it.",3
Defective product received. The cell phone is hanging up again and again.i recently visited to Samsung Care Center they checked my phone and said that your phone have some sort of manufacturer default. and even they r not ready to take any responsibility bcz i purchased online worst service from Samsung tired of sending mails to Samsung customer care,1
"Faster charger sucks. Initially, it was taking 2 hours to full charge the phone but only after 1 month after 3 hours of constant charge phone is charged only 28%. So, either charging socket is defective or charger is bogus. Don't buy this phone instead go for realme 3.",2

Sometimes heating issue does comes while I open Pubg.
Rest thing is kind of OK.",3

I regret buying this phone from Amazon.  As I have made multiple calls to return the item but there hasn't been any help.

Screen. Finger sencor is not very sencetive sensitive. And front camera is not upto the mark. Waste. More good and far better option than this phone is available in the market. Don't waste your money. Spacialy if looking for selfie camera. But battery. Look and performance  good.,2

"Camera quality is worst. As committed in product discription "" battery will be charged in 45 minutes. Its not up to the mark. It takes morethan 1.5hrs.

Front camera is too much bad. Phone heats too much. Phone hangs a lot. My phones hotspot stopped working in just one day. Nd Amazon is not even returning it. Too much bad service offered by Amazon. Never buy anything on Amazon,1

"Quality is very Bad, also it hangs ever time, it gets heat up often, it takes atleast 10 to 30 seconds to display the number if someone called even though it's ringing. Ultimately there is no reselling value, I paid 12k for new phone ended up recieving 6000 on selling after 3 weeks of purchase.

I suggest don't buy.",1
"Only 3 fingerprints supported while other phones at this price range even from older generations support 5. Camera quality is average at best, too grainy pictures. Battery life and build quality are awesome. Recent update to OneUI has improved the UI a lot and it's very friendly for one-handed use.",3
"Worst phone don't buy it. I have got delivered a defective piece which was having an issue with touch, later on frequent complaints and quarrel the piece got replaced but the replaced one also having display issue after two months. Not at all worthful. No return is allowed except replacement.",1

Phone is getting hanged frequently during normal functioning of phone. Supplied Battery charger is not as per specification mentioned on amazon website. Head phone is not given in pack",3
5000mAh battery and 3x fast charger? Battery backup is so as a 3500mAh battery containing mobile and fast charging aftrr 2 to 3 month has get it down..rear camera is good enough according to this price range but if you are a selfie lover you will surely get disappointed...i am personally not satisfied with this mobile phone.,3
"totally not worth it, i mean for the price i should not expect much from it, but atleast the product should meet the basic advertised limits. The phone lags too much, gets over heated, it automatically increases and reduces the brightness levels irrespective of the surroundings. Overall phone with zero stars.
DO NOT BUY",1

"Poor quality product, first time I have bought a Samsung product and I am very disappointed.  The product set had a poor quality glass, that didn't survive the slightest fall from sofa. Samsung is using cheap material and are cheating customers with bad quality products. Recommend others not to buy this phone better buy any other phone.",1
Initially it used to work fine till return and refund of the phone was available then....comes Samsung into play...pubg gets harder to play....battery life decreases and some times even it automatically restarts and some times audio jack won't work...so you should automatically restart it....better note 7 pro is best with this range,1

You'll not even enjoy 2G internet... repeat ..if you live outside of metrocity then dont buy it...worst 4g compared to others..... everything is good but 4G network is worst.... redmi..vivo gives high speed 4G at same place where this phone only shows loading..loading...and loading,1
"Very good phone. I like. But I don't know how will be long lasting. However it's operation is comfortable.  High speed battery recharge, camera is also good, fingerprints not so bad.",3
camera quality is bad..Brightness of phone is worst..even putting the brightness upto saturation point the brightness exhibiting is very low..can't use the phone in outer environment brightness...very cheap quality,1
"Result of front camera is very worst. When talking to someone on phone then some of the sound come from periphery of fingerprint sensor so that part is vibrating and getting heated.

I buy this because of, having a trust in samsung brand. But this is very disappointing to have such bad quality phone from Samsung.",2
"Samsung have provided the worst face recognition and the camera are very poor low light performance. Image stabilization are also poor in this device and also the finger sensor is poor. And about the screen, after two day of use the display got big scratches by bike keys in pocket. Please don't buy it phone",1
"low light camera is not so good. camera is the worst part of this mobile. Camera quality is very poor. PUBG game lag on this device even on low setting heavy frame drop while playing.
C type charger & Battery are only 2 highlight of this phone. UI is very slow. After using it for a month it is the worst  moble to purchase....it takes almost 3hr to charge.",2
This product is very dislikely due to low quality of touch .Also the camera quality is not accurate or non satisfying compare to A20 mobile. Its hanged seversl times when we use continuously and also phone battery back up very low its reduced life immediately and when we use phone some times with result that battery hot.,1
"Its good,but not very good.....somewhere ots superior but somwhere it has to improve much more.

Its very much durable,having strong build quality but its fingerprint sensor,and other features need some improvements.

Samsung have to make phones competetive to other phones in the Market.",3
I am big fan of Samsung Galaxy so I purchased this product but it totally disappointed me. The screen freezes and hang whenever I use. I have given the mobile for service but they can't find whats happening in the mobile and called me saying they found nothing wrong with the mobile after three days. Totally waste buying Samsung mobiles.,1
Good for that price range bad for games like pubg gud battery life camera quality is poor compared to samsung j7 prime any one observed or dnt know m20 is not supporting OTG,3
"Writing this review after using it for 20 days.
Pros:
Good battery backup

Rear camera is good
Display is nice

Cons:
Hangs up
Heating issues
Front camera is below average
Both cameras suffer alot in the dark
Bulky(because of massive battery)",3
Phone has good Features - but the Phone is not STURDY - little bit Moisture and can damage your phone - in heat condition - the phone while I was driving from Delhi to Dharamshala and back to delhi - the phone became too hot and the screen was light and phone was hanging - may be because it caught Moisture while camping,1
From first day of purchase does not working charging point of phone.Although I want to replace it but. Won't.And customer care executive's behaviour not good as well.I request everyone not to buy this.,1
If samsung want to get succeed in this segment than they have to stop putting outdated parts in their devices.its look like samsung is selling 2016 quality in 2019.the only highlight in this phone is battery otherwise this is not recomendable.camera display are most disappointing.,2
"I have bought M20 7 days back,

"M20 is overall best mobile review given after using 5 days.
1 negative point is some time it hang...after lock it's working smoothly again....

Battery life is 22 to 24 hrs with continuous running 'Net' ( including 7hrs standby night time without running Net connections)",3
Very poor sound quality. Speaker has so much disturbance. Trust me. Dont buy. I bought it thinking of Samsung Image and brand.,1
Please dont buy it. The battery heats up. Touch sensitivity is poor. My display cracked within 2 weeks from purchase. The screen is not led its age old lcd which easily breaks. Waste of mkney and time.,1
Very bad experience of using this device...using it for just a month and this phone is giving me issues...its getting hanged for no reason and the touch is also giving a lot of problem...very bad product...I recommend u not to go for this product..u can opt for some other brands with same process range and very good performance....,1
"Too much bad.the phone dose not work smoothly. The set slow.The set heated when it is charging. Didn't fullfill your quantity. And if wanted help from Amajon, they don't help you. And you have to carry this difective product. If u really want this set please brought from nearby store. Because Amazon delivered defective product.",1
"The camera quality is pathetic
And the selfie camera is even worse than pathetic
You'll hear a horrible noise whenever you'll call someone ( no matter what sim card you use since it is not a network issue it is a phone issue )
I requested for a replacement and they sent me a defected phone",1

Baki to pata hi hai..  6 month baad lag suru ... Recommended for ladies and boys who act like ladies",2
Never ever ever buy this product. It's full of bugs and problmes. The camera quality is just nonsense. The auto brightness is having a lot of bugs. Fingerprint sensor is nonresponsive most of the time. Facial recognition is slow as hell. Worst phone you can ever lay your hands on. Stupidest decision of my life.,1
"I have been using since 2 month.i have got lot of problems in mobile.1) very bad performance 2)I got heating issues 2) Face recongina cencer is not proper working. 4) main problem, volte is not working. 5)got network issue but same sim is properly working with another mobile. Jio sim, airtel, Vodafone is not working.",3
Not the smooth samsung experience I was expecting. Touch is a bit sticky and phone heats up a lot while playing games. Can't bear the load for even 1 hour and screen becomes hot. In terms of performance it doesn't feel like 4GB ram phone. Also its made for India only so I believe wouldn't work if taken outside India.,3
Worst phone it will last only six months. Long lasting Battery but what will you do if processor is not working. It hangs a lot. Fingerprint is not proper. Keypad touch nothing works properly. micro phone stops. Uncountable problems. Not good for gaming as well . Only good thing is battery.,1
"Camera quality is not good as mentioned.
Battery is 5000mah but last for 1 day only.
Too many preinstallled apps which you can't uninstall.
Hang while using camera or taking call.
Disappointed with the price and the performance.",1

# so my suggestion it is better for parents.",3
The phone is hanging up again and again....i mean its my new phone.... still...its gonna hang...this is freaking.....samsung shpild have increased price but atleast given a good quality phone....its cheap....😤😤😠😠,1
Everything abt this phone is pretty good. Started using phone after 15days of delivery. That's the biggest mistake I have done. Camera clarity is very poor compared to Samsung on pro5 though it's a basic model compared to. The front camera is blurry n sucks.. I wish I could return this phone... so is der any possibility to return?,3
"Phone is good in this price. Battery is good. I just didn't like the camera. It is not as clear as expected. Rear camera is good. But front camera is very bad. The selfies are not clear at all.
Still I like this product.",3
I bought this product few months ago. It's charger is giving an issue. Not sure if the problem is battery or charger. It takes 8 hours to fully charge the mobile. There is always a warning sign while charging which means either the charger or battery is faulty. I am very upset!,1
Overall performance ia good but the fingerprint reader is a bit slow compared to other phones in this price segment. Camera quality is good and the battery life is not fine and the charging time is less because sof type c port,3

"Look wise good. Slim and sleek. Photo quality is ok. Main issue touch performance not up to the mark. Touch suddenly not working, need to restart to work it(video available). Face recognition  is slow. Phone heating while charging. Samsung brand phone, but it not looks like the brand with these issues.",2
Camera ok but lot of inbulit apps ...processing speed is way to slow I expected 4GB to help but not upto my expectations...plus 4G data catching speed is very bad ...same network is comparatively fast ...Battery life ok ok but crazy adds every where,3
"Well very first it's UI SUCKS. So much of unnecessary ads to the notification, I literally have no idea. It's slow, file rate drops. Finger print is slow and not in right position, u need to take ur finger all the way up. Battery life is great.",3
"Good enough. Good looks. But it failed flatmates service part. There was some problem with motherboard coz of which phone reboots itself automatically. Its now the 4 week, the phone kept at authorised service centre and they say ridiculously that they changed 3 boards and all 3 were defective. As a brand it failed.",1

"There is a problem with samsung phones always.
It gets heated so quickly if I switch on mobile hotspot .
I had faced this issue  from the day when I purchased .
Battery is of 5000mAh , but why it should get heated when i switch on mobile hotspot ?
Seriously thinking to Exchange now",3
"Network issues. Calls get cut midway. Wifi much slower on this phone compared to others. Apps get terminated on their own.
Applied for a return/replacement but haven't got any update.",1
Samsung M series giving too much radiation. I hv m20 which showing SAR 0.274 and I feeling microwave vibration in palm while using it. This waves very harmful for body. So I suggest that go for other series or brand.,1
Phone is not functioning properly..more to it is slow in process..not recommended for buy...just a garbage box...third class...either samsung should work on it or stop manufacyuring the product...this type of review will be common when ur new phone is hanging.. no quality support..phone is over heated while phn is on charging,1

Worst phone. touch screen works automatically but when i need to operate with touch sometimes its not worked. Network strength also poor.,1
Phone is good  but battery performance  is not as we expect  from 5000mah. . . I didn't get 15v 3x fast charger . . . An ordinary  charger which charges  slowly. . . .it needs improvement in Charging & Battery Backupsome I m writing this review after using 2 months,3
I bought in behalf of my staff. But there seems to be a problem with it the sound echos when talking. I would have expected better from Samsung.,2
There is not cancellation is available in Amazon for mobile products. Waste of money . I thought to buy A50 instead i bought M20. Don't believe reviews in YouTube. All are paid by Samsung. Im a real user i don't like this M20 And touch is not properly working. Better go for A30 or A50 for this midrange budget.,1
"I feel, m20 was not user friendly. size was very big and more weight. screen was not swapping quickly when change the device direction(vertical/horizontal). Call automatically went into hold mode when take to near ear.",3
Glass of this mobile is of very low quality and breaks oftenly. Price of glass for this Mobile is very very very high in comparison of price of mobile. Price of glass is rs. 4500 which is surprising. Hence u will feel sad after purchase this phone,1
"📷 camera bekar hai
Iss Range me aur bhi ache fon hai..
M30 and M40 are much better.
M20 ki manufacturing quality koi khas nahi hai. Pics me acha dikhta hai but real me Attractive bhi nahi hai.
Bas ""As a regular"" mobile hi hai.. jese 7 se 8 thousands me aa jate hai.",3
Processor a bit slow. UX Lacks basic shortcuts and conveniences even after upgrading to pie. Lots of limitations . Only good for 5kmah battry at 12k. Lasts a good 1.5 day. A bit of Touchscreen issue's as well. Charcoal Black looks like dark blue.  Average but could have been better. (18 days of usage),3
"Best phone in this range. Initially i thought that phone is not good and it was hanging. But after somedays i realised its update issue. After updating running nicely. And battery is also, for me i charged once in three days. Camera is good but that much but nevertheless in this price range its good.",2
"Very Bad Smartphone from Samsung performance is not satisfying ONE UI is not that great as previous software, hanging most of the time, battery is bigger but powerless hardly last for 1.5 days. I do not prefer this phone at this price point it's better to go for Redmi or Realme  Devices who offers best specs and  performance.",1
Nice phone but during rainy season it gives problem during charging.  It has a sensor which detects moisture and does not let us charge phone.  You have to keep a hair drier with you to charge your phone Or keep it in silica gel to avoid moisture ingress.. Camera is ok.. Battery life is excellent.,3
"Phone is very slow I hardly had few apps loaded and using 1 app at a time still found it very slow.
Camera quality is very low.
If you for brand then it's good or else buy other phone they will give you much better performance",1
"All mobile new brands offered mobile case/ cover and screen guard with mobile to costumers .. Samsung doesn’t offered why??????
VERY SADLY 😡",3
Pathetic phone. I am using this phone for the last 1.5 months. Initially it was working fine. Suddenly it has started showing it's true colors. The phone hangs frequently. Starts functioning automatically. I feel cheated.,1
Hii guys this is the worst phone in this budget segment. Dont waste money,1

When it fell down once, it's screen broke just like any ordinary tempered glass

Heating problem to high
Amazon's have not any refund policy
Vey poor experience",3
"Product heats up and restarts automatically every now and then when you try to open an app or speak more than 3 minutes. Please don't buy it.
I tried to return it. It was very difficult to process it. Applied return request on 5.5.19 still waiting for Amazon guys after 5 Days ...",1
"Bought this phone out of curiosity for the hype created , but nothing has changed its still the typical Samsung model. Not at all impressed.",3
I assure you all..the camera is very bad..compare to my 3yrs old J5 model..its not at all 13mp...my product is heating at back..dont know others..5mp wide angle just useless...otherthan camera everything is good of M20..you can go if camera is not on priority.,3
Trash mobile.Amazon and Samsung both cheated.  Stay away from this mobile.  Got 2 mobiles.  One display issue and other one reboot issue. I request everyone to go for other brand. 12999 waste in 1 week,1
"Pro- good battery life  average sound, face recognition good,
Con- bad front camera, charging time 4 hour to full charge, fast charger doest seems charging fast, slow app response time",3
"It became Hot when Mobile data is open and also get Hot upper side of phone (calling speaker, near fingerprint reader area) at the time of Talking.
Some times its fingerprint reader can't detect Finger and also its screen touch some times less sensitive.
Its camera quality ans battery life is good.",3
"I do not know whether this hanging Screen problem is only in my phone or is this whole Samsung M20 series issue. I visited the customer care store but conditions remain as it is, most importantly all this is happening in first 6 months of the purchasing date. God knows for how long i can tolerate this phone.",2
"I had purchased this phone in the month of june 2019, since the date of purchase i have been facing problems with the speaker, which i ignored thinking its a software glitch. Even after resetting it and updating with the latest software update the issue occured and now m left with a phone which has no sound.",3
"Very worst experience from day 1,even I asked for replacement but ur engineer came to visit home and asked me to go samsung care for software update despite my phone was already updated..
He himself entered resolved problem in his phone...Very poor experience..Now I will have to visit samsung care again",1
not good quality product......brightness is very low......poor network quality and very very 5th class product ...do not but Samsung and from Amazon....no consumer facility and no company assurance...never buy mobile online buy it from ur local store....because Amazon once sell there is no warranty.......mind this seriously,1
Charging from 0 to 100% is taking 4 hours after latest update. Almost unusable now so disgusting Samsung.,2
"It was working fine but after some time it starts hanging and applications getting crashed. I thought samsung have overcome this issue but 8 am still facing this issue.

I will not recommend samsung mobiles to anyone in future and also i will not buy it.
This has broken my heart.",1
After using 1 month mobile hangs even after factory restore setting camera sometime not working depend upon mood. My advice not to buy this mobile even if they sold for 100 Rupees. Very disappointed after buying this product only waste of money and samsung is degrading their quality day by day.,1
Bought this phone on 7th feb.. but within month touch pad of this phone is giving problem and hanging of phone issue as always as it is samsung... Need to go customer service center and have to spend money from my pocket for travelling within 1 month only. Will not prefer to anyone to go with Samsung.. better will be Redmi,2
Since I changed over to this phone I  notice the internet is a bit slower compared to my old Micromax ( lower version) for the same SIM and same network operator.  I feel this is because of not very good data receivers provided in M-20 as compared to other lower models.,3
"This phone with 5000 mah is not even running for 12 hrs.
The dark screen doesn't come alive immediately. After call the screen is dark and to disconnect the phone you need to wait till the screen lightens up.
I want refund.",1
It doesn't have gorilla glass and screen is a bit upward which generates a very high probability of screen breaking. I can guarantee your screen will break within the first two years(google the cases). Camera is very normal nothing like j series or like brand value of samsung .  Only battery may satisfy you,2
please don't buy this product the camera result is very very poor specially front camera.The camera colors the face too artificial and color sharpness is senseless.also i talked with costumer care they told me to change some setting but there is no change in camera result. Totally unhappy with this product.,1
"After using it for 6months straight away battery has come down over a period of time, phone performance is sluggish.camera crashes a lot",3

WORST PRODUCT in 10 or 12k

THE WORST",1
"The phone indeed looks good. It has an amazing battery life. The cons of the phone are: 1. there is some issue with sound. the sound is very low. if you are listening the songs without earphones, the speaker is not.
2. Touch screen hangs sometimes.",3
"Honestly M20 is good smartphone. It's battery backup is best of best. I charge this phone in 2 days. But I have some issues because M20's loud speaker is not loud, front camera is very bad and Screen quality is not so good. It's an average and low budget smartphone. My rating is 2/5 ⭐⭐",2
"This Phone is not for PUBG and Other high resources games , games are only working in medium settings, Price,  Processor is not good , Camera Quality is Ok , Face Unlock and Fingerprint Sensor is very Slow. Other features are good ,all most all Sensors are given in this Phone,Software is good.",3
"This product is charging very very slow and 2nd...I am unable to download things as this product has some issue....might be vendor have sent the faulty product. But I didn't like this at all.
I bought this product on occasion blof my wife birthday but this wrong product spoil my surprise.",1
"1.Network Connectivity capacity is too poor.

Its takes 4 or 5 hours to get full charge sometimes whole night, I gave device and charger Samsung service centre so many times and they can't find what's wrong with the device and charger.. please don't buy this",2
I expected too much from this phone..The phone keeps lagging and the display is too huge to handle coz the screen sensitivity is too less.I suggest everyone to look for some other phone!!,2
"Recieved faulty set from Amazon. I Don’t trust Samsung anymore.
Pathetic service from Amazon. Their customer service has gone to the lowest level.
Flipkart is much better.",1
Verry bad mobile phone,1
One month after purchasing the screen went dead. This is for a brand new phone. Makes you wonder if you should purchase stuff off of Amazon. We didn’t even get the bill from Amazon for the same.,1

Its fast charging but still taking lot of time yo full charge but after charging battery life is good.",2
"The colour of the ordered product was Charoal Black. But when I look at my phone, it looks like a dark blue coloured mobile. I am very dissatisfied with this. Performance wise, the charging gets drained out in 9 hours. The camera quality is really bad. There is no image stabilisation. I suggest you to look out for a better phone than this.",2
" The display of the phone is not working properly,just after the date of return. There is not a single scratch on the screen and not yet even fallen but the screen came white and some lines on it.
So kindly look into the matters.
THANK YOU",1
One of the worst phone I have ever used. It started to hang up after a week from purchase and then for no reason whenever I put to charge it shows moisture detected whereas I cleaned the port and tried to dry it. It's been a week and I have to restart the phone everytime I put it on charging.,1

Samsung M20 general functions r good. Rear camera is very bad. Close photos only have quality. Battery backup is very poor.  Maximum one day is coming backup but I expect better performance with 5000 mah battery. I think the battery power shown in features is for bluffing. Screen resolution also not good.,2
I brought this last month.  But now it's not working properly  .. touch screen is main issue. Help me out from this issue  .. I cant able access my screen  . Feeling irritated with this M20  . Even though I brought this in EMI ..really dont know what to do.help me out,1
"I am getting massages of moisture detected in my phone that’s the reason it’s not charging.
This is pathetic experience I went to YouTube and saw I am not the only one thief are customer who are facing same issue ,that means the software is faulty sumsung should look in this",2
Samsung can never do what mi is doing .,1
"Received a faulty mobile, touch isn't working properly and there is also issues with charging. Taking too much time to charge and sometimes doesn't respond while you plug it to charge. Camera is worst in its category.",1

The product has a great battery performance and well balanced RAM management keeps in memory all my useful apps. Although the Fingerprint sensor doesn't work sometimes. Automatically the touch screen works. Flashlight turns on automatically. Single press on power button makes turns on the shut down mode.,2

2. Back finger sensor can not use directly to see the lock screen.
3. Net speed indicator is not available.",1
I am not satisfied with this product. 5000 MAh battery is the only good feature in the phone. Face recognition is not work.camera clarity is avarage. I liked to give an avarage grade Samsung m 20.,3
"This phone sucks! DO NOT buy it please. The touch is pathetic! You keep hitting, it wont work.....freezes etc. Sad I cant return it now.",1

Well i have been using this this device more than a month now.Till now have not face any lag issue performance is uptomark what can be expected from device in this range.Display is of high quality.Low light photography is not adequate and is average.Rest according to price samsung delivered everything.Which samsung usually don't give to users.,3
"I have made a huge mistake to bye this product. It's a worst mobile phone ever, I request everybody to pls do not bye this mobile. And there is no replace and return policy for this product",1

"Initially it was awesome but it asked for mobile software update frequently,  after my 1st software update split screen feature not available,  next camera picture quality gone worst, night mode photography gone worst,....even now it is asking for software update frequently...",2
"Contrary to samsung mobiles, the quality of this phone is really bad. Speaker doesn't function well and therefore, the output voice is all cracked.
Camera is also not as per expectations, or probably broken.
Overall, I will suggest not to buy M series samsung phones.",1
Faulty product was sold to me by Amazon. Phone stopped work after one month. The mother board is faulty. Nothing works on the phone. Not sure how Amazon is allowing such products to be sold on it's website. Samsung franchise who repairs the mobile is completely useless. It's been 2 months. Phone is not fixed yet.,1
"This phone like old Samsung not any new updating,  hanging problem and touch not working many time I am very disappointed with this phone I was think it's new series so now buy  but my very big mistake with Samsung,  and still only purchase 20 days .so please don't purchase m series phone it's very bad phone really.",1
This is such a useless product series from Samsung just to compete with other online sellers like Realme Redme 1+ etc. Bought this phone on release date in Feb 19. Camera like a toy. No clarity. After appx 1 month network IC struggling to catch network. ( Generic issue of Samsung phones).,1
The Samsung M20 mobile is showing problem in display from 6July 2019 which is getting more and more day by day.Please find enclosed the snaps of the display . The mobile is getting hanged and heated very frequently. And the problem started arising in notice from the 10th day.Tried to communicate the amazon customer care but no response.,1
"Everything is fine except... problem with volume buttons..... which forwards videos for it's own.... some defective piece..AMAZON need to double verify BEFORE DELIVERY.

online shopping relies only based on trust... Amazon needs to retain its customers by improving quality and other issues.",3
Think twice if you want to buy this phone i have bought 2 phone  m30 nd m20 nd im suffering from bettry problm microphone porblem and they will not replace your phone if your are suffering from any problm they will give you refund nd waste your precious time so dont buy this series worst series ever.,2

I bought this phone in the month of April but now few days ago suddenly it hangs up even after some time hanging is continued I gi to the Samsung care centre they told me that you connected your mobile with laptop that's why they are hanging even that the time of hanging its not connected toh my laptop,2
After using for 20 days now most of the time of charging it shows something “moisturiser error”. You have to fight for 4-5hrs with the phone and do something to get charged and sometime the phone gets slow !!! I even don’t play game still it does not work properly. Not a good phone at all.,3
Not had great experience this time phone had mic issues other person on the call does not able to hear my voice carefully . I expected good from Samsung like brand.,1

Worst front camera i ever seen. Rest of ok,1
"This is not good choice. Battery back up is very weak. It take hours to charge and very quickly discharge. Camera not so good and clear .Networking issues,hotspots  is very weak. You can find better phone with this cost. I would advise not to purchase this phone.",1
Better throw money in Dustin instead of buying this phone or any Samsung phone... quality of screen is so bad that it blended automatically and the person at service centre are say it was done by high pressure and do u think it is possible to give high pressure on edge of screen ... plz don't buy it,1
"The features  are good...and I'm satisfied  with features..
But main thing is the HEAT'S more.....

Trusted brand like Samsung giving this kind of trouble to the customer... not at all expected",1
Dear samsung dont make this type of defective products ....and dont sell it to the person who has lack of time....,1
"The product is very bulky and have heavy weights....pubg player can switch to redmi or realme...not good for pubg, if u r a samsung lover than u can buy this....back cover and screen guard makes the phone more bulky....camera is amazing, sound is also good but samsung can improve slimness of the phone and should provide metal body",3
"Bought it a bit higher cost 10K could be 8K max.

"1.heating problem  , 2- up and down light , 3- this phone will be charging hour 12 hour chargin problem , 4- network , problem , 5 -thisis wrost phone of samsung or amazon joint venture.",1
This phone has only one good feature that good battery life. Rest of the things below average. Specifically Camera and OS. Both are very bad and not even up to the mark. There are better options available in market with same price tag and much better and enhanced features.,2
"Good Battery.
Good Speed.

Freezing often after one month
Fingerprint is good and extremely sensitive.
But protect enabled there is  bug which ask for unlock twice",3

"No options in video camera,like slow motion and timelapse videos.Very sad!!front camera is very poor!Rest phone is very good!!!",3
Everything is good except the front camera. Front camera photos are automatically blurred by the system. Its hard to believe that its 8 MP camera. It seems to be a 2MP camera.,3
Our all phone is working well. Advertising pop up was problem while operating phone. But resolved after application setting. Worth buying this phone. I switched to Samsung after using other brand phone in same price range which will give problem near to one year of using.,3
front camera is below average. processing speed is also below average compared to other phone at this price range. Battery backup is very gud.,3
"10990/- good phone by Samsung. Lil but lagging sometimes  but it's ok because  it's not  that much expensive  phone. Camera is good
Performances I can play pubg in medium settings. Heating issue : phone heat hota hai but garmi bhi hai bahut. Overall am satisfied.
After 4-5 months experience its lagging and hanging",3
Is that the phone gets heated up very fast to a level of 41°c and they will try their level best to do anything not to give a replacement and there is a decrease in battery life then when I phoned the Amazon center they said do this do that but I never got a replacement biggest mistake of my life,1
I baught a Samsung Galaxy M20 mobile phone  from Amazon  two days ago. I am not satisfied with phone because handset was very slow functioning and no any application installed in phones through plystore . But I want to say that handset looking is good and also back camera & battery black so good.,1

Don't buy samsung m20. Its been 2days i am using this phone back cover is not good. Camera is ok. Facelock in worse. Samsung app lock is mussing. Much better to wait for Samsung m30.,2
"Light and crispy, but I wish the implementàion
could have been done better! Avoiding some major error like inability to copy file from SD to home screen. I am sure it will be fixed in future microcode update without which selling this mobile will be a hard task. I hope some one is listening!",3
Camera quality is too bad,2
"1. Display 5/5
2. Battery 2/5( draining like water)
3. Front camera 4/5
4. Back camera 1/5 (this is not expected from samsung)

There is no Image stabilizer on front camera, no led, no front flash.
Think before you purchase.",2
"Phone is not good, I used couple of days, batter life and  finger print is very very bad, after using 30min phone will be heated up, no vibration availability for wrong finger print.  But camera is good, compare to this honor 10 lite is best phone,",3
"This is a total waste of money . The face recognition stop working after 1 day and continues to register your face again and again after each day otherwise ""no match "" ...I m just a regular user and cant get enough out of the features and dont suggest to buy it ...",1
"Finger print reader is bad. It's been just 3 months that I bought it, and it doesn't works at times. Had to keep my finger on the sensor 4-5 times for it to read that. Needs big time improvement. Battery is good. Gives approx 24 hrs of backup at full charge. Rest everything is fine.",3
"Camera quality is not so good. If you have used samsung premium phone earlier like S7 edge Note 9. Then you will hate M20 camera.
Finger print sensor are not very fast.M20 is thick phone. Screen gives a decent display.Rest is your choice. If need any more info then I can reply.",3
I don't expect samsung has given this type of cheap phones.  Processior was worst.  Hanging issues should be there.  Overall very bad quality phone i ever purchased. When I opened the camera it was hanging when I was opened the application it was hanging.,1

The problem usually came after 1 month of its use. I have invested 11000 in this phone. I am really disappointed with the product.",1
"I was unaware about the Regional Sim Lock while ordering M20 device, I travelled overseas a lot and now I feel like this is not useful for people who travel like me. Not happy with a purchase.",1
Utterly disappointed. I bought this phone only for calling purpose despite having 4gb ram the has become terribly slow after just on month only. No app installed. I should have bought some other phone,1
"I was using iphone6s and moved to this phone...its slow, display  is bad... if you are already using a good phone but thinking of change keep yourself away from this.. am writing this review after using for few months",3

This is the first time when i got the defective piece from Amazon. The mic of the phone is not working. When someone calls he / she can here their own voice.

I stopped using Samsung earlier because it used to hang a lot of times and I taught they must stabilised now and hence I bought this M20 mobile but again same problem i.e it hangs lot of times,1
"Product has come with full of viruses and bugs. I was trying to get rid of it but couldn't. I thought there might be problem from applications and so I did factory reset twice but it didn't work. I visited nearby store as well, they told me if you have bought from Amazon then this is expected.",1

"The battery life is no doubt the best part about this phone I but even like all other features such a fast charging, wide lens camera, transition effects and many more.

"I'm reviewing it after using it for 20 days.
Camera is decent, fingerprint is not upto Mark, it lags a bit in comparison to some  other phones of same range. Battery is sufficient. Good for those who don't game  but not for mobile gamers. The build quality is good at its cost.
Overall decent at its price.",3

Overall device is good. But it has heating issues under normal usage. My Redmi note 5 did not have this problem. Thankfully i am not a gamer. Battery backup is solid and fast charge is a welcome move. Device charges in 2.5hrs from 0 to 100. Amazons delivery was fast and amazing. This device deserves 2.5stars out of 5.,2
Samsung M20 Is not a smoothly mobile. application not working properly and camera quality is also poor,1

The product is not good.. actually when I on the phone the display was not good😒 and I can see some damages over the phone. i thought it good to buy in Amazon but in my case they didn't even check the product. I have asked for replacement but still they are processing the replacement.,1
This product only works with Indian SIM card. Unfortunately this information is not mentioned any where in the product page: information. Wanted to use this phone for International usage. Found out about it too late!!!!,1

I talk to amazon technicians bt no resolution.",1

Fingerprint sensor is not as much quick accessible...camera quality is good but getting blur at left corner of bottom which effects on picture captured...battery life is good but not as expected to its capacity of 5000MAH and phone and charger both are getting heated when on charging mode.,3
No LTE. Slowest phone ever. One drop and the screen cracks. Waste of money even if they are selling it cheaper. Don't go for this.,1

Don't buy this mobile.it drops signals frequently .I tried with all top networks  the problem  is the same slow internet. I visited  Samsung  service  centre they said they will be looking  into it .if problem  continues. Worst phone when signals are considered.network frequency is very poor.i think they should fix with an update.,1
"With the Samsung flagship, this model really disappointing me. Specifically it's body and finishing of the body is totally pathetic. Ohhh one more thing is hanging issue. If Samsung wants to get back the market from others they have to do a lot of improvement.",3

"The brightness many times suddenly gets low.
Many app hangs as this processor is very bad compared to snapdragon.
Touch is so ridiculous that it stop detecting and gets started only after locking and unlocking the phone.
Pure recomendation is no buy, agar fir bhi chahiye to mujhse le lo",1

When I asked for a replacement, they don't take seriously, just ask to install some app and nothing happens..
Won't buy anything from Amazon ever again...",1

"The camera quality is pathetic, others brands have beaten this product in every aspect. Even after 2 years of using Motorola G4, I have not faced the 'Hang' issue, but with this mobile it has started after 1 month of using.
Don't waste money on this one.",2
It's TRUE that this phone is looking ugly and so heavy weight. And not performing well. M series phone online wale andhe logo ko sidha sidha 'C' bana raha hai. Just buy A series phone if you want buy only Samsung phone.,1
The touch is not responding sometimes. Camera is average but the wide angle one is awesome. Phone weights a little heavy owning to massive battery. A hell lot of advertisements are appearing from samsung on the lock screen which is annoying. Go for it only if you are not heavy. user,3

After using MI Note 5 I switched to Samsung but to be very honest it was my big mistake. Those who are using MI or other brands please don't buy this phone. Not a single thing on this phone runs properly.  Very slow response. Camera is worst. Completely waste of money.,1
"Hey battery charging is very bad it is not  fast charger it is  slow charger
I I charged at 12:30 . p.m. at 28% after 3  and half hours it's charged was 80%",1
One of the worst phone I have ever seen it is getting hang many times I went to store they said will upgrade the software. But the problem remains the same,1

Got this product in offer with exchange of old phone for Rs 8300.. slightly disappointed when compared the same with my friend.. as my display was little faded... camera clarity though dull... wondered how the same phone varies .... battery was excellent....,1
I like the camera. Battery backup is average. Sound quality is pretty good. Network may let you struggling sometime. Overall average phone in this price range. Samsung needs to improve in this segment.,3
"It's awful.System performance is dull.Its very slow.Camera also not good. Suggesting, go for other brands. At least don't purchase M20",1
"The charger cable provided with this purchase is very small. you have to struggle to find the closest gap between the power socket and the resting place for the phone.

Touch on this phone is not that great. you have to press little hard to move between screens & icons.",1

I can not use Abroad, what is this useless trick by Samsung, why You are doing this, It was not mentioned while advertising!!!!! I am not happy at all !!!!! Though Battery life is good, Camera is average.... not up to Samsungs earlier Quality....",3
I bought black color got blue. Tried exchanging amazon respond was worse to it.i brought this phone for its picture capturing highlights. But it didn't reached my expectation. It only works best in sunlight. Battery is good.,1
"Display,  Audio and Battery is so good.
Camera is OK.
Not suitable for gamers, very bad performance in games.
Those who want much battery life & enjoy music or watch anything can take this.
Those who want to play games ,plz dont buy it.",2

"Worst mobile ever purchased. Bought it with lot of expectations from Samsung as a huge brand. But I think Samsung is not concerned about its brand image by making such products. Apart from long lasting battery life, nothing is appreciable. My old mobile was much better than this.",2
Cant accpet this as worst product ever purchased from Amazon.. I gifted this phone to my brother but after 3 months of use there was an technical problem which was soon resolved by samsung CC but just after few months again same problem occurred..,1
Finger print sensor was not responding well and it stopped working after 1 month of purchase. Problem of phone hanging is inherent / fundamental with Samsung. Battery life is excellent and camera quality is decent.,3
Samsung's take at budget phones screams poor software ui. The camera is laggy and software freezes from time to time.,2
"You can get pros every where so i am talking about -ve of the device.
1 This device is not having secure folder and another lock app.
2 Not supporting the knox securities.

"This phone has quite dull prospects for the price, back panel feels cheap, cameras are not upto the mark, PUBG can be played on low resolution, Only good thing about this phone is it's battery, in fact, it is great, Samsung has tried taking on Xiaomi but it has failed miserably.",3
"Camera quality is very poor. Nothing to say about it.
Battery life is one day for a new phone of average use without gaming. As processor is not so smart and intelligent it consumes more battery.
This phone come below realme etc. in this segment",1
"Finger sensor and face recognition doesn't work and when it works, it takes forever to get unlocked.
Camera quality is poor.
Network connectivity is poor.

Worst device by Samsung.
Regret buying it.",1

ITS JUST WASTE OF MONEY TO BUY SAMSUNG M SERIES.",1
Battery doesn't last one whole day even..not a patch on mimax 2 with lesser battery capacity,2
Doesn't recognise my face or finger prints while unlocking the mobile. Camera is okay but not good in night. I wouldn't recommend it to buy rather go with keypad phones coz in the end you just gonna pick and end calls with this mobile,2
"This is the worst mobile, don't take this phone even for free.... I trusted the brand and bought it in first auction without going with user reviews, but definitely this is the worst phone I have ever used, Samsung low budget phones are worst,",1
"Not a good phone, in 2nd week of purchase problem have started..
automatically keypad types, different apps open together, every time such problem occurs, restart is required",1

Worst phone ever used. Earpiece sound quality is worst when compared to other phones(keypad phones give better sound quality) . This phone won't catch network. Moreover it is heavy. Please don't buy this phone. Samsung has built a phone with cheap quality for affordable price.,1
"My experience is totally bad overall  -first the build quality is so cheap it totally bends/ scratches....and  i do not recommend this phone not to anyone and i think if I’m not wrong the whole m series is made of carbon fibre plastic ,I recommend A series rather than m series",1
Worst phone ever.. not worth of it buying ... Who ever is buying please don't buy,1

Poor quality of blur live focus is only for name",1
Don't buy this Samsung m20 b coz this modal front camera is captured photo blur I was go Samsung service center dadar and he changed front camera but still this problem not resolved after 3 month use his charging problem,1
"Very bad product and very slow .
One of the worst product of samsung.
Average looking and very bad camera.
Very slow fingerprint reader.
Only thing is good ....Battery life.
It's obvious when every thing will  slow then battery optimization will be slow too.",1
"Other then its overheating problem it ok.
Most of the time charging gets stuck on 85/86% doesnot charge further n then show overheated, and then cant get access to any of d apps.
So overall its major  problem is overheating.
Pls. Tell d company to resolve our problem",1
Phone is just ok. Nothing great. It slows down and gets stuck with fast activity. Problem with keypad too. Camera quality sucks. It is worst than a basic camera phone. It just makes you ugly in pictures. Selfie is horrible. I would not recommend anyone this phone.,1
In the first month itself the phone was getting heated and was used to switch off and there was battery discharge going around during this time and when I consulted the Samsung care they said display issues and replaced it under warranty .. will post another review afterwards,3
"Good budget phone, Battery backup is excellent, Call quality and the speaker is average not so loud, Camera wide angle is New and Awesome feature but image quality is not so good.",3
"I was little disappointed on camera section, both cameras are not good when compare to other mobiles in this price category, indoor shots are very dull and not sharp, in wide angle image quality is little low...except this mobile is very good...",3
"I am personally using this mobile since last 3 months. It was performing well.
2 days before Suddenly its display got blurry. However, There is no impact/ damage or any thing happened with mobile.

"Don't buy this phone guys, the phone is very good performance is also nice but what's the use when your is broken after fall from 2 feet. The display material is not even gorilla glass and extremely delicate, my screen is broken after very short fall.",1
This handset is one of the best smartphones having enormous battery backup upto 1.5days..screen look and fingerprints scanner is quite good enough..V like shape of front camera is just look like Vivo v 11..,3

Dear all please please please don't buy this product..(Samsung M20) After 2 month screen is broken...very bad quality of display..broke from falling 2 feet....*Display repairing charges 4500 Rs. Half price of mobile* ..No warranty/Guarantee...  pls pls pls don't buy this..,1
It's only one month purchasing Samsung M20 phone. There is a line mark on the screen. It is not a physical damage. I don't have option for replacement on Amazon. Kindly need help on this. I had lot of hope on Samsung phones so I bought it. Kindly give some useful solution.,1
"Samsung M20 is not as Mi or other devices..
It's slow in the start and camera quality not satisfiction than others phone..
And many features not available this phone, just like app clone, internal security system e.t.c
So i don't satisfied from this phone...",3
"I purchased 2 M20.but M20 ocean blue sometimes get hanged and sometimes automatically taps on screen and runs sevral apps automatically, like automatically types msg on watsapp and send it, runs google search automatically.i trust samsung n amazon and hope they will contact me soon.",1
"Avon mobile touch quality is very good, camera is average,  battery backup is very big almost 1.5day battery backup on average use, look of mobile is very nice, from my point of view in this price m20 is best. Only one fault it's weight is heavy.
This very good job by samsung",3
"Worst phone ever, except the battery backup nothing is good at all. The screen is so delicate it broke on a single drop from a 3 feet height even with protection.",1
"Worst phone to buy compared  to other phones at same price ,and amazon donot  offer u a return . So if ur a frequent uses donot buy this product",1
Not a good choice handset.. other mobile manufacturers are far better than Samsung.  I believed in Samsung but I was wrong. Finger print sensor are freezing and processor is very slow. Need to improve network stability.,2
"it is hanging a lot,front camera is worst . no clear picture .please dont buy this stupid phone.Instead of this buy redmi phone they are far better than this phone.",1
I tried to charge this mobile....but it was not responding....i raised compliants to amezon about phone....they are not responding.......do not go to this mobile purchase .....no body not responce....,1
Horrible phone..  the case is very cheap like plastic.the screen is very delicate and small drop led to major scratches. Also the selfie camera gives blurry pictures. Sensors are really bad. Also te sound volume is very low.. only positive is full screen display and battery life.,1
"Within a month after buying the phone,  white vertical lines appeared all over. They wouldn't go away. Should have steered clear of Samsung given that their phones have display issues. Definitely my last Samsung.  Rubbish quality.",1
"Look good
Battery ok
Camera not satisfied even compared j7
After one month I fed up with this mal operations, display running automatically and finally stuck up",3
I PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT ON 21 FEBRUARY 2019. THE PRODUCT IS GOOD BUT SINCE LAST 3-4 DAYS ITS GETTING HEATED UP WHILE CHARGING. SO NOW WHAT TO DO? PLEASE CALL ME,1
"this phone is having issues with the network strength while others with same network properly working this phone is all the time showing not registered on network , continuously facing the issue now going to samsung gallery , its a waste of money .",1
There is problem in processing... Suddenly stops all operations n goes in sleep mode... Keypad functions erroneously... Automatically starts erasing whatever I type...Very strange...,2
Given 3 star because of processing speed. Not a single app installed in mobile and phone processing speed is pathetic even on dialling a call. Expecting from buyers to write correct reviews.,3
The 32GB phone with 3 GB RAM has already reserved 10GB storage for system..that's really weird..,1
"Very poor mobile,I purchase for my mom ,for birthday ,mom not use the mobile 1week after that she change the sim use the mobile ,mobile is very slow camera is frezz ,mom not told that problem ,now only she told me but return policy is finish ,what can I do...",1
I m not satisfied,1
"It's very worst segment of Samsung.. No camera quality, no speed, especially I open any apps it takes more time in new phone.. Rely bad experience with Samsung.....",1
"Video recording observed vertical background lines, checked in friends M20 phone also same issue seen. Purchased this phone during Prime day sales.",1
"Problem with when charging time hanging and touch pad not working.
Two time engineer visited,After Replaced mobile again same problem.
customer care team want to send technician.
10 Days already  done ...
Not refunding my payment....",1
"Samsung galaxy M20 (3gb + 32gb) hangs up 2 or 3 times a day though there are more than 15gb free in internal storage.
Other quality is good.",3
"The phone is below  standard  on all the measures.. be it camera, sound quality, touch, fingerprint reader",1
This mobile worth for money after Tow month speaker is not working properly I claim the warranty in Samsung services center the repair the phone in free of cost,3
"I  did not like figerprint sensor it is bad...
Battery durability is awesome .
I am nt that satisfied  with the front camera..
And charging is not fast..
It almost takes 1:45 hours..to refill itself## unlike the vooc chargers
And face unlock is very bad  ..",3
"It is taking 30 mins to get charged 1%.Network issues, sometimes getting blank.Phone get blackout and nothing works.Very bad experience with the brand like Samsung.",1
This is completly a bogus product. I have nothing but repenting after purchasing it. The system is not working properly. As per company product is equipped with 15w type c charger but it is taking more that 3 hours to full charge. This shakes the brand image of samsung.,2
"battery is good for first 6 months
worst product from Samsung M20 never try to buy this mobile
worst camera
worst mobile body ( total plastic)
waste of money dont buy
samsung cheated us
i have very dad opinion on Samsung
you samsungm20",1
Samsung Galaxy M20 is a worst product. While receiving calls the screen becomes dark and gets locked. The same thing happens when u call someone. Often hangs. Touch screen is not good. Overall it's waste of money. I am searching for samsung authorised centre for repair.,2
I bought M20 only for its 4gb ram.But the inbuilt apps consume 3 gb and only 1 gb left. Then its speed is equivalent to my old  vivo 1gb ram mobile,1
"I'm writing this review after using this phone for 2 months.

Overall good phone. All other features are upto date and very good. But major flaw is it's battery. It's not getting recharged quickly, takes more than 4 hours to charge fully. This is not at all acceptable.",3
Camera quality is poor..... It gets open without finger print when locked just a min ago... It hangs too much within just 3months it started to hang,3
"The processor is for name sake , the mobile lag as like all samsung mobile , I have bought this phone for battery backup but its ok. The features offered in this mobile is very less as compared to other mobile's of same price range. Don't buy unless you are a Samsung fan.",2
"Poor Camera quality , front camera is totally waste and lagging in performance during multitasking",1
"Network for internet is very Bàd ,Here Showing net speed 600 kbps whichever  available  data network  3 MBPS Showing in other phone tested in same location and same network.",2
Sim 2 not working properly voice is very low ...waste of money..Dont  buy In Amazon  no support properly for defect phones..,1
"Fingerprint sensor is good but not the Samsung lable, it's not responding thoroughly.
Camera are not as powerful as they say, its capturing very average quality pics.
The best thing about the smartphone is its battery. Rally a good one.",3
"This phone has very poor fingerprint reader, average touch screen but camera is good as well as battery life. Most annoying thing in this phone is it pops up so many advertisements when unlocking the phone inspite of blocking those from settings.",3
Best mobile that gives me great fade photoes and heat at temp that could use to press clothes brilient processor sometimes i play pubg and press home button then pubg photo  is obtain at home screen so that i did not want to choose walpaper it take own the best phone under 13000,3
"Very disappointing mobile, I expected very high from this mobile,the camera quality is average, fingerprint sensor is worst, for battery life I would prefer iPhone instead of this,not at all for gaming, a big mistake buying this mobile",1
"Overheating while using Mobil data.but Amazon customer care analysed phone through an app and told, 38 degrees are acceptable and. Above 49 is eligible to return. I am not able to hold Mobile while using Mobil data.",1
"Very good phone from samsung
Things liked very much are
Battery life
Daylight camera photos
Samsung display

Things that did not like
Low light camera quality is not so good.
Samsung default home launcher behaves laggy sometimes.",3
Please don't buy this series phone.  It will not met ur expectations if u re expecting good with as and anroid phone.  Came quality is poor plastic body is there. No doubt battery life is amazing.  But only battery is not sufficient for using a smart phone.,1
"Awesome phone, great battery ..nice camera , back camera is more powerful and capture delicious pictures. fron camera is little disappointing...!",3
"Worst phone compared to other brand. It has 4gb ram but lags plying videos, games like a phone from a decade ago. Has a very poor performence . Touch sensitivity  is also wierd ,",1
"Don't buy this phone , hanggin too much . Voice quality is not good. Automatically contact number is deteted even you saved in gmail account. Over all this product is not preferable
 as per samsung brand name.",1
Picture quality is not good & connectivity is very  bad,3
"It's a good phone. Fingerprint reader, camera quality are very good only that the battery is not all that strong as I expected. Also it produce more heat when used for longer hours. Apart from that everything about the phone is great.",3
So much hanging problems I have already rebooted my phone 3 times and now I want to sell it on OLX at just rupees 7000 only so my suggestion is only that don't purchase it I already suffered heavy losses and I don't want you to suffer,3
"Useless phone. Facing Display and Fingerprint sensor problem after 1 month of purchase.

"Screen stated moving itself, touch works without touching,hanging, fingerprint sensor never open before 3-4 attemp, camera quality is not upto mark. Overall  performance is very bad. Complained  about it to amazon but they have still not taken any action to return it.",1
This is Samsung's worst mobile I have ever used.what the f....K this is mobile that Samsung introduced very poor performance....Friends don't buy I am seriously not suggesting this mobile...even small games not working properly...don't buy it.. go for high quality....,1
Its neutral with low budget and medium quality phone. Thinking about camera doesn't give u a slow motion. Large bulky data consuming apps like tiktok doesn't work properly in phone though have great 3 or 4 GB RAM. SUGGESTION IS YOURS. Though it's a good quality phone.,2
"Look wise - OK
Battery - OK
Display - Average
Front camera - Worst (Bulers the photo)

"Looks like a reused unit has been stuffed into the box by tearing it partially, box is damaged at both the ends where the box opens, did not expect such product from samsung and amazon. Very dissapointed.",1
Call/Phone and Camera Menu hangs again and again you need to restart the phone to fix it.,2
"Phone hang so much. If u want ur phone work properly you have clean the ram 5-6 time in a day or sometimes reboot. Processor is worst. Fingerprint reader is not up to the mark. Camera quality is average. Bty life is good, but what it worth if the processing of the phone is too slow.",3
Mobile has too much heating problem and it's not splash proof front camera images are so dull.  If you order it from Amazon you can't return it unless it have a big issue,2
Motherboard problem. Defective phones selling online. The phone is Bent slightly. No response from Samsung customer care since it was bought online. No return or exchange also available. We have not used the phone at all. The phone looks slightly identical bent.,1

"Except for Brand Name, everything is substandard. Battery dies fast. Phone heats up often with auto shutdown of apps. Hangs frequently. Sheer waste of money. Worse than unbranded chinese phones. Sheer waste of money",1
Touch is very gud.. camera is also gud... only problm is.. it takes lot of time in charging.. although it has fast charger,3
This is one of the whrost phone front camera quality pathetic face unlock most the time fails I bought this phn just because of battery but it is also bad full charged battery automatically discharged in 12 to 18 hours plz don’t buy they don’t provide return policy,1
Camera and battery is good.. But performance and touch is very slow.. because of performance issues I am not buying Samsung low cost mobiles. Recent years low cost mobiles are giving very good performance now a days. But Samsung failed to give users that performance,2

The product did not last for more than 2months. Battery got drained up and phone refused to start. Even after repairing it did not improve. We are thinking of getting it replaced as its still under warranty period.,1
"Camera very bad.
FFace detection not at all good.
Didn't expect this from Samsung.",1
"If you are looking for phone  good camera don't buy this because quality of front camera pictures is very poor. There is also lagging problem, so definitely this phone should be bad choice for gamers. Display resolution is better, battery life is better.",3

"Screen and body is made by very cheap material, my phone was broken within a week, dropped just 1.5 fit height.",1
Fingerprint reader is not working properly sometimes it recongnise the user and sometimes not. Most of the times you have to manually enter the screen pattern to unlock the phone. And battery is also draining so quickly.,3

"The end strips broke off easily, rendering the phone without protection from falls and knocks. The clips connecting the end strips to main body tend to break off easily.",2
"Overall the product is good but I am facing issue of disconnection of calls whenever I am on a call. This is creating a big issue as I am unable to talk on conference call as it gets disconnected, always.
Bad experience related to calls.",3

Camera and fingerprint sensor is working ok but battery is given 5000 mah and its working like 2500 mah battery now you can imagine how the battery is. And it has mic problem also. When i answer any phone call he ask me restart if you want to use the mic.,3
"It's 5000 MAH battery and it gets discharged in 2 days max with very less usage, finger print censors are very poor and camera quality is also not that great",2
A very average product at this price range..finger print scanner hardly works..the front camera works as the ambient light sensor so sensitivity is less and is very slow to react..battery life is good..screen sensitivity could have been better,3
"Great for old generations.
Could have been better if provided with a good processor.because you can feel the lag of you use a powerful  processor smartphone before.
Well lastly Samsung need to optimize their UI for better experience.",3
"Camera sensor is not working. Quality of selfie is also not good.
Requested  Amazon customer care to replace, but no action taken in this regard",2
Screen broke when it was handled with care (in product description it was mentioned as best glass). Now when I want to change the screen it's costing around 5000,1

The camera is not working properly and th features are not good. We have ask customer care to return but they reply not to refund. This is not the way to donot say truth. This is not the way to behave very bad. Firstly improve your behaviour and then do marketing.,1
"Hang sometimes that is very poor.Ram management is better than MI devices,day to day life usability is good.Camera is average battery life is good.overall average phone could have been better.",3
"Pretty average phone when compared to rivals
Better if you buy other company phones if u r only interested in Samsung ya it is a good one .
Best for parents,and less user.
Not for gamers",3

With 5000mA i was expecting atleast a day long battery life..... but it does not gives more than 18 to 20hrs of normal usage.... camera quality is bit ordinary.....operating speed is also below my expectation.....,3
Finally Samsung welcomed a Notch,1
"Don't expect something spectacular
Avg battery life
Avg charging
It's an average buy
A 3 star product",3
"Charging port issue exist.
Unable to charge the phone.its througing USB moisture error.

Gets heated when playing game.
It's ok for normal use only",1

Buy this one if you have time for service center visits",1
"Phone is laggy(even when used by my father who doesnt play games or use multiple apps) . Camera quality could have been better. Overall not so happy with the product. High end Samsung products are good,  but not so much the low ones..",3
"Worst product.. there is signal problem with this hand set.. call drops..
The Same Sim works fine with signal in other J7 max Samsung.. PLEASE DON'T BUY.. THIS SET
SAMSUNG SHOULD CHECK THE QUALITY .. SET HAS SIGNAL PROBLEM..",1
I thought this will be a good and durable phone. But in its 4th month only it started giving so many problems.. sensitivity is not at all under control. Keypad sensitivity is totally destroyed. Phone gets hannged 5 6 tyms in a minute.,2
"Picture quality is  very good  but this phone have a hanging issue,  got so many time hang my phone,  and some app run automatically",3
"All over good but sound output not good samsung this device, 11,000 rang best phone as u like",3
"Battery performance is excellent, but processor is not good enough. The device is overall OK",3
"During charging phone over heats and after removing of charging apps close automatically by displaying phone overheated apps will be closed with in 20 seconds, it is highly irritating. And rear camera poor quality in night light time. speed ok.",1
"If you need battery package in this range it is best and camera is quite average it beautifies you over the range , and overall quite good phone",3
i dislike its heating problem when i charged this phone  than gets access heating i cant touch it,3
"Priceworthy performance but both the camera's are disappointing...if u are looking for quality images then dont go for galaxy M20.poor camera .good battery ,you will get more than one day battery life.  Fingerprint readers are good .",3
"It’s been 4 weeks I’m using this mobile and completely disastrous. Network signal totally sucks, Redmi is far better and could see the performance is going down everyday",1
Don't buy this Samsung m20 mobile. Already  I bought  m20 mobile on last Feb 13th.There was a  problem from last two weeks. This product has no battery life. It has no proper screen response.Finally this is a waste product.,1
Fingerprint reader is very slow sometimes have to touch twice or thrice to unlock And in mine handset handsfree mic doesn’t work. And their is little light visible from the top of the display little left to notch,1
I am fed up with the cell phone M20. I have tried to explain to Samsung service stations at Honda Goa as well as in Delhi.  My complaint is that call receiver cannot hear my voice after sometime on recieving call,1
After using for a month now I noticed a few things my phone is lagging and sometimes my fingerprint scanner doesn't read my finger print and the camera is so annoying so many filters even if we close them,2
"Worst fingerprint reader ever, have to keep finger for at least 2 to 3 secs to unlock. Mobile goes not responding mode sometime, we had to lock and unlock to make it work. This issue observed since day 1. Camera is ok but in the low light the clarity won't be good.",1
product is very good but the build quality is very worst just I dropped from one and half feet the whole screen is broken even installed screen protector also Samsung should make a good quality product,3
"It seem a lot that i have bought an advertisement display from samsung,
Continous flashingbof unwanted ads on my locked and spare screen...turn my important activities to junk...",3
"Face recognition is pathetic, charging is worst than lower versions of Samsung mobile. Battery backup is poor. Am really not happy with Samsung.. since 2008 I was away from the Samsung but made a mistake purchasing again now in 2019.",1
"Mobile having a feature that it will not allow to charge the mobile if the charging port is having any moisture content,but it is irritating me, because how we can get it dry, if it dries automatically then it will helpful for users.",1
"Worst phone I have ever seen. The basic functionality itself not works. Not able to answer incoming calls. I have already returned one phone due this issue and my replaced device also had the same issue. Finally, not worth for money.",2
Screen quality of M-20 is one of the poorest in the league. The screen liquid has been damaged within 3 months from the date of buying and samsung doesn't cover it under the warranty scheme. Very sad for my choice  of going for M-20.,1
Unnecessary ads pop up on the screen and there is no option to remove the ads. The camera quality is good with regards to the price. The battery life is fine.,3
I’m not satisfied as the phone is hanging and the apps are not working fine but when I diagnose with smart check app it shows everything is working fine and the amazon customer support not accepting for return.This phone is not worth,1
Attention! Attention! Attention! Plz dont buy this third quality phone ....very low grade quality and hanging problem camera is very poor over all experience is very worst this device is made with very cheap material and I never recommend such a down grade device,1
Not good I have visited to service center more than fifteen time totally west of money,1

"Worst mobile - Mobile Given better performance for only 3 months - After that Mobile hanging , Fast charging not happening - Charger Connector not supporting - Whole night charging only 50% of battery.",1
It takes in moisture in the charging port and blocks charging until the moisture is dry sometimes you have to wait 20 hrs(whole day and night) till moisture is dry and you can  charge your phone again.,3
"Worst phone ever...asks for update every other day ..poor camera quality...internet is also not working properly,I tried using all the network  providers and have also done all the settings...its been a month and it hangs frequently",1
I bought Samsung M20 few days back. New mobile has many issues. The screen flickers often. Poor quality testing and QA process. Defective products launched in the market without proper due process followed. Avoid buying Samsung M20.,1
"Phone is good but i think mine one is Defective Piece as the selfie Camera slowly got the dust in it after the 2-3 months.. but i didn't want to use repaired mobile so i didn't go to service center.. Including the Pictures fo selfie camera
but really it's CHEAP..",2
Face recognition and finger scan is of average quality. Takes time to adopt for surrounding light. Average touch sensitivity and accuracy. Average camera quality....,3
"Overall nice device but network issue is there in this device. Same SIM cards was using on MI phones give better network coverage, but in this device network coverage is so pathetic.",3
Very poor picture quality and battery backup very poor,2
The Mobile Is Okk Selfie camera is okk loudspeaker and sound is low.. take more charging time. But Samsung brand thtsway its taking more Price then others.. in This Price many Mobile giving Many Features and Best Camera..,3
"I had a very bad experience with this phone and I suggest all my dear frnd dont buy this phone if your phone get miss from your hand the screen will get broken and u have to spend 4500 for replacement. Phone is very slow.

Worst touch screen it got scratches just in few days of use and plastic back is too is very low quality it got scratches 3ven by small grains of dust. Really disappointing I was not expecting these cheap materials from Samsung company.,2
"I would suggest not to go with m10 or m20 phones by samsung. Hell lot of lagging issues.
Looking forward to sell it after using for 1 month.
No software updates to over issue of lag.",1
"Front camera working as like sensor for auto brightness.
Face recognition is also slow.
Mobile is good, camera picture quality is good,
Battery life is good
3/5",3
Display problem but company not accept in warranty,2
"On 16th feb mobile is delivered the first i took is one selfie with my bro , for first time it hanged. Not able to go back , home .its hanging... scroll is not workinb properly.  While watching videos in face book pop up appears at the interval .",1
"Very worst experience. Please don't buy this product. After one month of usage, battery unable to charge even after replacing the cable by Samsung service center issue not resolved. Samsung service is not ready to replace the unit.",1

"As usual, Samsung phones got start hanging after using 2-3 months.",3
Hangs alot. Showing its true colours after minimal usage. Waste of money. Too many ads pop up,1
"Very Poor quality, getting hang, poor camera, audio is not pleasant, getting hot, taking much time to charge",1
First of all legging problem in call function.  And heating problem during call and data uses . And this handset having hanging problem after updates .,1
"1.Camera quality is very very poor
2. Size of the body is big not a thin..

It should be very thin; easy to handle",2
Just a useless phone. Reviewing after use of 6 months. Just useless....even data on the phone got lost.. I have used phones almost every company.. I highly recommend you not to buy any series of Samsung phones,1
"This one is very bulky phone , charges at average speed better is M30 but light Weight and good one is A series only M series is heavy one. If u r spending 13k spend 2k more and get good one A series",3
Phone is good in budget segment. I am facing lags slow down of phone during cast screen feature.Somtime Ui freezes after opening heavy apps and phone restarts itself.but it can be solved by software update if they will provide it.Front Camera is below average and back camera is average.,3
The fast charging feature is depends on voltage of your home..if your voltage is good than it will fill to 100% in 45min otherwise it should take more than 3hrs.. and initially battery life was good but now it's performance worst.,3
My overall experience with this phone has been the worst. Hangs very often.touch is too bad.Though Camery quality and the battery life is very good.,1
"I will never buy Samsung products and suggest to all that Samsung galaxy m20 have got about 21 to 25 time hang problem in just 30 days of use. Sometimes it runs itself.
So I am unsatisfied with big BRAND samsung.",1
The look of the phone is great. I remember my first phone is Samsung. It was delivered on 3rd July today is 10th August. The phone failed to show display. This is where Samsung failed. Go for MI or Huawei which are best,1
Worst mobile phone. Display got off after 10 day of purchase. Service centre is full of complaints with M series phones. Do not buy.,1
"Like camera and gaming performance
Battery life is awaysom no heating problem
But dislike one is scan the phone in some files error and delete and no bad",3
This phone is always hanging off all the times... I feel so bad for this product.. Even I never expected this from Amazon and Samsung brand..,1
Phone with 4 gb ram and 64 gb internal storage is running slower than a 2gb ram and 8gb storage phone. Perfectly done samsung. Product looks good but can barely complete the functions of calling and typing without significant lag.,1
"Sometimes touch screen not works properly.
Sometimes it appears that phone is hanging slightly.

Battery and rear camera is super duper perfect.",3
I received manufactured defective item. First one week was fine then started hangging with out touching the screen multifunction happening. Not able to receive proper network signal.  I felt they got me to sell defective price to me.,1
"There is no protection on the screen, even a slight drop shattered the screen into pieces. There are other phones at half the price which offer better screen than this one. And Lots of bloatware in the phone.",3
"Very bad product of Samsung.
Hangs every 2 mins. Screen gets stuck and it automatically opens different different apps. Suddenly makes call to anyone on it's own..Irritating. even when I am writing this, it got stuck 2times.",1
This is the worst phone ever used. Before completing 15 to 20 days it's display is damaged we haven't used it properly but the employees of service centre our not listening anything. I would recommend all of uh not to purchase it,1
"Worst mobile ever seen before plz dont go for it ....I'm using this touch doesn't works properly, no. Issues are there in Mseries mobiles",1

The phone is one of the best phone with very good battery backup. The camera quality is not very good  compared to similar ranged phones. Finger print reader is also not so fast in the section. Display quality is good.,3
"Phone is ok, but battery is not up to the expectation. Fast charging is not working.",3
Finger print is not working properly camera quality is not good  but battery life is very good. If you wanna buy for battery than it is good but for other features like camra processors is not good.,2
Pretty Average Phone...App lags all the time even if you don't play games...over heating issues...Camera is average... Display is good... Battery is good.,2
After few days this phone is autometicly play it mean this phones all function autometicly open without touch the screen now i hate this phone,3

"Battery Life very good.Picture quality not good.sound quality ok.Processor not working properly .This phone gives me very bad  impression  about Samsung Brand. Atleast this should work properly.Price does not matter,it should work properly.",1
Writing this review after using the phone for some time... I would suggest to go for MI phones as u can get much better option at this price. The phone hangs a lot and finger sensor is also unresponsive most of the times. Camera is also average.,2
"Camera is avrage but battry life was super and fingerprint is little slow than MI mobiles but this is best mobile for gamers and students
But it is not gaming mobile because it was some time lag and  heating so much",3
