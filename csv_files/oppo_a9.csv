"Don't wast your money to purchase this mobile - I hv wasted 15.5k.

You will not get OTP.
Vast camera.
Bank app will not support n other.

Good display only

Ur wish",1
"I have purchased after a mini research on the web like any other user . The Marble Green look is awesome . Migration from Old Phone to new phone was smooth due to Clone Phone app installed in Old phone (you have to install in old phone from play store or web) .The only disadvantage is You cannot use dual sim with SD card .My old one was Panasonic and it had this slot for Dual Sim plus SD card .This phone offers dual slot but second sim plus SD card cannot be fitted . The usage , streaming , audio are excellent . Photos in low light is also a great feature. With 4GB and 128 GB it is a good buy as of now . Purchased 10 days back .  Hope OPP0 A9 guys give us double sim plus sd card slot -this can boost sales",4
The handset is really good.. Its camera quality and battery backup too,5
"Oppo a9 2020 has 720 resolution and oppo a9 has 1080 pixel resolution.

Don't go for 2020. üòÇ
I love this mobile.
Buy from local shop with same price as mentioned above.
Happy to have this one.

Also recommend you to buy this if you have budget under 16000.

Thanks oppo for this amazing phone with valueable price.",5
Oppo A9 is good in working and best features .Battery Superb.Rear camera average but enough to take photos.Selfie camera good.Comparing with competetors Price is high .,3
