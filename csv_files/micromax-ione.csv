"Defective Phone
1. The mobile phone came with a crack on side panel.
2. When tried to call from the mobile, my voice was not audible at other side. Tried using headph but still the same result.",1
It's a great phone in 5000. Good battery life and greatest screen smooth and awesome. Camera is not that good but if it was higher the night mode would have been great help then guess that needs 13mp camera at least. But in other modes it's good,5
"Awesome looking phone for this value. The back cover is quite glossy specially in black color which makes it very attractive. Decent camera and good speed. All in all, a great value for money.",5
Damaged inside at left down side.,1
Not bad,5
"Worst mobile I ever had purchased.
Network is the basic thing in any phone, but it's not working at all.
Battery is too weak.
I recieved this mobile on 6th Dec 2019.
And today I requested Amazon for return, and replace with another brand, they are having so complicated process regarding this. Complete wastage.",1
After 2 months use will add review,5
Ok,3
Speaker not working,1

Some times Network Problem,

Total wastage.......
One star also waste for this Mobile........",1
Its value for money.......lite weight....good look......its ok for this price rage..,4
"¬†Worst product, I bought it on 1st MARCH'20 and it got dead since 12th of this very month,  and being its amazonfulfilled item I launched a complain at Amazon on 13th Mar'20, and on 16th of the same month it was to be taken returned. But the delivery boy refused to take it return as he was unable to match the IMEI NO. Now, who has the whole day to speak to their C care representative regarding it. Due to shortage of time we go for online shopping....
Worst experience from both MICROMAX and AMAZON",1
Good,5
Guys product is good for basic use. Came is not so good. But ok as per budget. Sleek light weight & compact design is attractive. Face unlock is ok.,4

"Mobile is good in all aspects except in size.  Screen size is small (is it 5.45""?). This is great disappointment.",5
This is waste of money. If anyone want to buy any smart phone spend a little bit more and get a branded like Samsung or any other brand. I bought 2 of this for my mom and dad they are old school people. Even they don‚Äôt like it. Rest you will know if you buy it.,1

"about MICROMAX I-ONE PHONE_
d supposed technician never turned out.
1st 1 switched off.
2nd 1 said he resigned.
Some1 @these outsidely sourced or may b even an insider in league with dm for this is happening to almost everyone @QDIGI r tarnishing d Amazon's image.
& just eating into d co.s turnover.

Edit on dt. 29.02.2020: IMPORTANT:

d person on d Amazon's tech team got d screenshots for d IMEI no. of d device mailed, d way he asked to.
Said only after dt he cud b able to proceed with the exchange thing, which he certainly did.
HE SAID THE SCREENSHOTS of d IMEI I'd given him r SUFFICE TO MOVE FORWARD.

@d time of replacement, d del agent said he'd ascertain d IMEI no. Said d 1 with dm{dt is provided by me to d tech.} didn't happen to tally with d same n presently shown on d phone.
#*?$*ü§êüòñü§î!?
Which reason dy said dy cancelled d replacement.

d del. agent shroudedly wudn't say a bit abt. d shud b IMEI no.
Nor d 1s @every other desk on d great Amazon.
And they returned it....
OR GOT IT RETURNED!?!

I saw dm to b trying to dissuade me to pursue further. I didn't deter.
After a lot of trying, dy lift but cuts short. Else listens, but only to rope me in into their line of TWISTING.

NOW, WHO'S d...

Edit on dt. 02.03.2020: VERY IMPORTANT:

Amazon allots d date for a pickup for d refund, IMEI doesn't match hence gets cancelled for a refund on a daily basis.
So, d phone is not even d refurbished but a replaced 1 even with  box. WHERE? By WHOM??

Now, mailed d seller. Rather very attentive, more frndly dn d Amazonians @least up to this issue, knowledgeable so as to try ‚ùìwent ‚ùå n if possible to make it right ‚úîÔ∏è.
He provided me my shud b IMEI and also mentioned dt d present phone with it's IMEI was sold by himself to another retailer off ds platform.
So, how did I get ds?

NOW, WHO'S d...

Edit on dt. 03.03.2020: VERY VERY IMPORTANT:

The pickup person comes daily, acts as if he's calling his counterpart on d desk.
S, it clearly meant to b acting. & he screen-shoots my proceeds as much as possible to provide thru not by mail as it's used to b with Amazon but by WHAT'SAPP?
He stopped taking d IMEI, calling d c'care. But goes on talking n on private phone number. {He even used to call me from d same pvt. No.? when d occasion demands?}

The desk daily says they r sending a series of reminders to d courier desk to look into d possibility t enable d pickup inspite of d non-matching of d IMEI.
The later sent a sticker type paper with d 'Scan thing' on it.
The pickup wud continue to reject to say it too had been not working.
He wudn't show me like d same as with dt of d IMEI No. saying rules doesn't permit to show d rejection.
He continues to WhatsApp on his private no.

This time, so as not to b turned away didn't give him d phone and instead called d C'c. He heard their assurances n d teams pursuing this issue.

Totally shaken and afraid, he called his person in league on d other side.
NO IMEI test. NO SCANNING test.
All of a sudden, it got okayed???
May b d God knows, how?
He processed d pickup and d day-after I got my payment refunded, say my mails n all. Well, I'd to go check it.

Now, did these fellas try to take d advantage?
Did they think dt @ my being dissuaded by dm like this wud make me uninterested to pursue further?
& day cud go with their altered/ original phone of mine which shud hv been mine?
Now, will day replace d original so as to send it back?
Or still dare to send d morphed 1 ?

NOW,, r THESE d....
SO, WHO'S d...",4
Value for money... you can‚Äôt get all these smart and advanced features with a Made in India trust Brand elsewhere.,5
Very bad quality phone. Battery got damaged in 4 months. No support from service centre. Will never by micromax products.,1
Good price normal use good mobile,5
Best mobile love it,5
Best piece at this price. It's almost one year for me using this phone. Not a single problem detected till now.,5

Grow up guys. This is the worst phone you can buy. Spend few more bucks and go for another brand.,1
I think  micromax company shut down already.....,1

"My requirements were-
Non chinese (desh bhakti), small screen (for comfort hold & pocket friendly), notch display(new craze) and front flash (for wattsapp video chat in bed without needing to switch on lights) and below 7000 (i vent my anger on fones at least twice a year).

The big disappointment  was that it didnt have front flash, which i presumed it had, due to the fotos on amazon. Strangely, even the manual says it has front flash, but on selfie mode, screen flash works only.
THat was one of the most important factor for me.  But since hardly any notch phones have flash and they are selling well, i blv it is not an important factor for most people.
Secondly the camera although takes good fotos, doesnt have manual focus, which i blv is norm nowadays.
Very nice phone and size is very suitable for hand hold and back pocket comfort.
Display is good and so is the battery life. Doesnt get warm and notch looks exciting at least to me.

It is a great fone for 5000, made in india by indian company so my money remains in India and can be used for further development in India. That further explains my mindset while buying a Nano and recently an XUV500.",4
Excellent in every aspects and sometimes lacking in text photography.,5
The opposite of the model is not available,1
Very good product,5
