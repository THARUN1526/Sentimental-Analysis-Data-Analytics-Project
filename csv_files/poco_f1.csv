Expected a replacement and had battery issue but got back my money though and had to purchase a 64 GB storage phone under the same price (they have no control on pricing as it keeps changing everyday) and got that phone replaced again because of battery issue. My third replacement is thank fully working properly.,2
"Such a wonderful phone in this range
845 snapdragon which is the latest that is in it.
Just go for it.
Sexy phone",5
Received the phone was happy to see the packaging. Get a screen guard and back cover on the earliest. Get a screen guard on the earliest as the anti scratch layer doesn't last very long as it is 3rd generation gorilla glass. Over all phone is perfect although the build quality could've been better. I am very happy to have this one as it caters to all my needs perfectly.,5
Its all what i wanted from a phone.The fingerprint scanner is fast.The IR face unlock is fast.And the performance is also great.Overall a great phone.,5
Beast at this price range,5
Amazing pics n videos... I m in love with this phone.. nice n fast  .. awesome pics. Great battery life.. a real flagship phone,5
Total waste of money I bought it and replaced 2 times still there was problem of gosh touch means multiple touch problem and screen changes its color after 4 to 5 days display problem so if u r reading this review then plz don't go to this mobile total waste of money.,1
Refubished product sold,1
The phone is functioning well however after 2months of usage I can feel a small hump in the back side of the  rt corner . Not sure what it is,2
Was a bit skeptical about the battery coming from a 5000 mAh cell but believe me it gives the best battery performance. Snapdragon 845 is Godly!,5
"This phone has Superb Pic quality and amazing features, almost everything which you actually looking when you buy any new phone.",5
"Very good phone very sharp screen. Phone camera is the best as compare to other high end,phones.",5
"Bought it (128/6 GB version) for less than 14K during sale with exchange offer and other multiple discounts. Superb phone. Butter smooth operation. The call quality also improved over my previous Sony phone. The audio video quality is also excellent. Main camera is superb. Has a long battery life - for power uses also.
As cons, there is a bit of screen bleeding issue at the bottom and it also registers occasional false touches when screen gets accidentally contacted with headphone wire. But these problems were also existent with my couple of earlier phones. Seems to be a generic problem for some low and mid range phone nowadays. Its a shame that technological advancements are, sometimes, practically making the phones poorer, qualitywise - definitely a lack of adequate and proper quality control in the manufacturer's priority line. If you can overlook the above two cons, the device overall is a pretty good buy having high VFM.",5
"My father's oneplus 5 beating the gimmick poco f1 8gb 256 gb...

Amazon india is just disconnecting call when i wanted my refund
No help from Amazon
Really bad experience from Amazon call center
Wont buy a single thing from this site again

This product is the best value for money compared to all the phones I purchased so far. The battery is excellent - Lasts almost a full day even for heavy users. The processor speed is great and the phone doesn't become warm even after extended use. Quick charge is extremely effective as battery gets charged very quickly. Even the speaker and picture quality is excellent. The ring tone library is not very attractive. Also it takes a while to get used to the phone commands.,5
Good mobile but not full value of money.,4
"I have ordered in September 2019 ,but the package that has been sent to me is of Oct 2018 , which is an year old. The screen has bleeding issue and the battery backup is pathetic.

"I ordered Poco in Great Indian Festival Sale. Poco I received is manufactured Nov/2018 with nvt panel and it has slight bit of screen bleeding in lower edge. Seller should be selling newer units, as older units had screen bleeding issues. I bought this phone because of development support. Gonna replace this.

Update
Replacement received, manufactured Oct/2018, same screen bleeding. Returned.",1
Beware of the product you are receiving. I ordered it in Oct 2019 and the product i received was manufactured in Oct 2018. The phone was dead so i thought of charging it. As soon as I plugged the charging cable the phone swollen from the backside. Please check the manufacturing date before breaking the seal of the product.,1
This is One of the Best snapdragons 845 processor phone with best camera which is far better than redmi note 7 pro. Highly recommended if u are gamer. And wants best performance under 20k price value.,5
"It is a beast in the world of smartphones. Theere is no best phone in the world, just the best suited. And this phone best suited for me. Battery is upto the mark. Storage is just killing. I'm filling it with tons of apps and it's still just on 2%. And the armoured edition looks damn good. Screen is good for me. Because I prefered natural colors over flashy. Touch is buttery smooth. Finger touch is sooth as hell but the face lock option is just killing man. There was a problem of usb debugging. But it wasn't of mobiles but charging cables problem. So I had yto buy another cable. And the problem git solved. Overall I'm much satisfied. So if you wanna phone under 20k, don't want to strain your eyes, prefer natural colors, and don't care about notch then just go for this beast.",5
"Poco F1 used to be a hot product when it was launched. Since then many new updated products were launched but even then Poco F1 is a capable device with previous-gen flagship-grade specs. I got it just for such specs at rock bottom prices.

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

1. Good quality & solid but plastic build.
2. High pixel density screen with very fewer bezels.
3. Rounded corners of device & screen to provide refreshing looks
4. 12 MP capable back camera with a depth sensor for blur effect, & dual-tone flash. Edge detection is quite good.
5. 20 MP front camera with flash. Photos are beautiful with beauty mode on. Even w/o depth sensor, portrait mode works well with proper blur effect.
6. Very effective face unlock system with a dedicated IR camera and IR illuminator on the left of the earpiece. Works well in low light also, n unlock time is 0.3-0.5 sec.
7. Stereo speakers for an immersive loud sound. Earpiece doubles as a speaker.
8. Fast fingerprint sensor, unlock time 0.2-0.4 sec.
9. Top-notch performance via Snapdragon 845, Adreno 630 & 6 GB ram.
-Easily plays demanding games at high settings like Castle Seige, Mortal Combat, Dead Trigger, Asphalt
-Overall OS is smooth with nice gestures & no lag anywhere. Its all blazing fast.
-Will heat slightly during extensive usage.
10. An awesome battery of 4000mah with a backup of around 1.5 days with moderate to heavy usage.
11. Lovely full-screen gestures as an alternative to buttons on the bottom of the screen. More screen real estate available to use & it's a refreshing way to go back, home & to recents.
12. Perfectly working screencast/miracast. This feature mirrors phone screen on smart tv with direct connection b/w phone & tv. Although it also supports DLNA which works via wifi router.

‚ûñ CONS
‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

1. No OIS of photos. So low-quality shots in many situations, especially night ones.
2. No EIS for 4K videos. So avoid shakes anyhow.
3. No IR blaster as is with most of MI packages.
4. No waterproofing. Flagship tag should carry along this thing too. But I think you got a max of every world already.
5. Notched display. Some may like, some may not. Though there's an option to disable notch where the screen on either side of the notch is blacked out to but this wastes screen estate.
6. Hybrid sim tray. So you can use sim1 + sim2 or sim + memory card. But i think you have plenty of space already. Also, having precious unbacked data on the portable risky device like a smartphone is a bad idea. Lesser the space, more careful we are with the backup. Years ago I lost a lot of precious data coz of that.

üèÜ VERDICT
‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

If you want to save some money and not a notch hater then there's no reason to not get this device even today, when its really hitting rock bottom wrt price. Also, you get a previous-gen flagship processor & very good performance at a low price.

So it's the best time to grab deals & get the top model of the late 2018/early 2019. Also, device is not very old as of today's standards.

Getting a device right after launch is a costly affair. But when its successor (k20 pro which demands quite a premium price) is launched, it is like grab the deal, as its heavily discounted to clear out stocks.",5
"Hey Guys,
Its one of the best phone in this segment...!
Its really fast and handy with good battery backup. The memory of 128 GB & 6 GB RAM gives you vast space for storage. It also support fast charging which can charge your phone from 0 to 100% with two hours. I also checked by opening multiple app & games running together but it doesn't gets heated. I bought it for Rs.13,400/- by exchanging my old Samsung A5 with extra 2k bonus on exchange and I could also claim 1500/- off with my SBI credit card.
Thank You Amazon...üòç",5
"Received oldest stock (Manufactured October 2018). This is my second Poco F1, bought the first one on the launch day from other platform( where Poco F1 exclusively sold there). All the initial batches have had serious QC issues. I again received from initial batch, so I am not sure how many QC related issues I will face with this one. Absolutely disappointed with Amazon. This is not the only old stock product I received, I purchased about 6-7 lakhs worth of products (from my personal & business account) during this month, many products especially below 20k value are off very old stock(received clothes manufactured in early 2017!).",1
My mobile phone glass has damaged wt should we do,3
"The performance for which I've given it a 1 star is increased after the first two updates. Now the performance is fine but the phone's problem still not ends here. The battery life mentioned here (4000 mAh) is not what it seems. I get severe issues with the battery life. It ends too soon when I play games. And when battery is low it lags too much.
The charger is not a fast charger. When you play PUBG with charger plugged in, charge still decreases. I was already prepared for screen bleeding but the multi touch issue takes it to another level. After the second update my face unlock isn't working good. It's hard to register a face and doesn't work unless I'm too close to the phone. The right side back button gesture is also seems to failed when the phone is on landscape mode.
It's worth buying if you are prepared for these issues.",1
"The product box seal was in opened condition, the product was not damaged, the Amazon packaging was excellent, not sure why the phone box was not sealed. The phone is excellent, great battery life, great speed, good buy at this price",5
"I brought this Poco f1 8GB Ram on Diwali sale just before 2 days.. But extremely disappointed. The joy of buying the new phone did not last long. Calling is the main feature of any phone. And the Mic doesn't work from day 1 on this poco f1, the caller or hearer on the call keeps on telling me every 20 seconds that your voice is breaking up. I initially thought it to be network problem but when I tried with all my family members Sims  , the problem remained the same. Mic doesn't work. I guess they are selling us a refurbished phones. I am waiting for the technician tomorrow if its not fixed will return it. Extremely disappointed the phone look and speed is Good though",1
Nice product,5
Poco F1 has been a very good phone (I bought the Rosso red one - looks nice). The charging is also quick (though not as quick as Dash charging) with decent battery life. Phone doesn't hang. I had 2 options in mind - One plus 6T & Poco F1. The only edge 6T has over Poco is quality of photos (esp. in low light) but Poco is not that bad at all. Moreover has good processor & decent RAM. Overall best value for money !!!,5

"Got the armoured variant at 17k after SBI cash back. Been almost a week and I must say its amazing. 3 things I like the most. First the IR face sensor , superquick.  Second is the camera as after installing the GCAM for poco F1 its software processing becomes so good that it beats many of the flagships priced double than this. Thirdly the battery life , one word - adequate. Apart from these the texture of the armored edition feel very premium. Definitely a must buy for less than 19k.",5

It may be subjective because in my case, I am using this after S6 edge and Oppo F11 pro.  Software is also good. I liked the gesture navigation. It's worth the price.",5

2. best for gaming (for this budget just close your eyes and buy it)
3. camera is amazing, especially google cam ports for this device.
4. battery backup is amazing and charging speed is good too.
5. just the notch is too big, yet it comes with infrared face recognition system which is like more than 98% reliable and lightning-fast. we can live with that. (yet ASUS Zenfone 5Z can be a good choice too if you have a little extra in your pockets).
6. I bought it for 19000 when it was launched, I lost that one now I am going to get another in just 14000/- thanks to this big festival sale).

"Actually there is a huge issue regarding the product which is screen bleeding. Initially the mobile has been good but after using for 2 hours I just started to observe that pale red colour lines appeared on the screen and I was very dissapointed. And to know that this issue can't be fixed I was totally messed up. So, the display was an issue with my product.But every thing was fine",2
Very bad experience for this product Poco F1. TWO times replaced but same issue faced. Screen going on disable state while trying to type anything ... for first time while doing the setup for new Poco F1... this kind of issue faced.. Rating field is mandate to submit the review.so given 1.,1
"I can say this mobile is better or i can say far better then any other mobile which is near to this price,if anyone have used this mobile that person only get to know about this beast, and few picture I have updated to check the clarity part of the camera but you guy's have to try the night mode which is inbuilt and you will be getting feeling of DSLR.

Everything is perfect but as you know if perfect is there then there some miner issue will automatically popped up and the issue on this mobile is the battery you if you have used less then 4000 Mah battery then it is good for you guy's but gamer like us will never satisfied with battery and for normal user just close you're eye and purchase it and if you want you can see other persons review which make you very setisfide if you have bit interest on this beast.

Thank you for reading my review.",5
i got a great experience with it in all dimensions.It has a great display whis helps me while playing games and watching videos as well.while talking about it‚Äôs looks Can say it‚Äôs good but it got a attractive slim body which make its look great.it has one of the fastest processor snapdragon 845 which helps you alot while doing heavy work and multitasking with it and it will not hang and you can experience a soomth working experience with it.,5
"The phone is good but the seller is clearing the old stock with screen bleeding. My original order, as well as the replacement, had the same issue. At the end, I returned it.

Having said that, Poco F1 is still a solid phone in 2020. Get it from somewhere else or wish you don't receive a detective unit like I did.",4

"I made a mistake from shifting from Oppo to Mi Poco F1
My Oppo F9 pro become slow I bought Mi Poco in frustration thinking a 8GB phone will solve the issues. But, its a NO as this phone takes two hours to charge 100% and battery too drains very fast. While Oppo was quick, 45 to 60 mins phone is 100% charged. Also, this phone is equally slow like Oppo which become slower after an year of using. Doesn't worth for the money spent on this",1
"Everything is good in this phone except that ""screen bleed issue at the bottom"".

That attracts my eyes every time I use the phone and pissing me off! Apparaio retail is sucked to the next level and sent old 2018 unit to me in 2020 wth üòñ
Xiaomi is not taking responsibility and telling me to take the 2 days old unit to the service centre üòñ that's not cool.

However, UI is very good in POCO than Redmi, it's a bit broad in form factor so feels solid in hand, the polycarbonate doesn't bother me at all, even looks good than the glass sort of back, Camera is good, Speakers are ok, IR face detection is in the next level, truly fast unlocking.
Looks like a good phone and I do not like to categorize any device as premium. It should solve the purpose and have good specs and design.

However, I HATE the screen bleed at the bottom.",2
"Initially,I got a poco F1 6GB/128 Red defective version. The phone had some touch issues like less input lag,abnormal high/low sensitivity,scrolling lag,poor battery backup and I also  noticed for some weird reason there were scratches on the new charger, So I've contacted amazon and  Kudos to them, they have initiated a replacement instantly. So far,the replacement phone works just fine,no touch/input lag/scrolling lag issues,the battery backup is decent with a SOT of around 9.5 hours on normal usage on latest 10.3.8 stable,stereo speakers/headphone jack output is decent,camera is great,battery heating is normal at around 34¬∞C for moderate usage. However,I think all poco phones have substandard low qualitytouch panels with some of the issues being fixed with hardware in the newer batches and some with software optimization. Also bear in mind, the date of manufacture of poco phones amazon sells is of old batches of around october 2018 which is about a year old. But,overall I'm happy as the replacement product is fine as of now,price was value for money and also the acko accidental screen protection 1 year plan is a big plus.",4
"I ordered the blue color with 6gb ram
When I received the phone the seal was intact but the phone already had a screen guard also I found a small crack at the back cover towards the lower end of phone

 When I asked for a replacement the process I have to go is very frustrating
Still no response from Amazon",1
"Having used a lot of phones including the Redmi Note 7, Samsung A30, Redmi Note 5 Pro, Redmi Note 7 pro.. This one is the best. Super fast, excellent pictures, excellent battery backup and the best part is it's connectivity. 4g speed tests on all the above models with the same sim in the same environment... This is at an average of 15-20% faster. Wifi connection speed to 5Ghz network. Almost double than other devices (pic attached). Played PubG..Highest settings by default.. No lag.Ultra smooth. Apps open extremely fast. Multi-tasking is like butter. Doesn't drop 4G network easily. Extremely strong network connectivity. Only problem is that if you don't use an 18W charger, your phone won't get charged in 10 hrs!!!. Last line. The best beast in mobiles I have used",5
Waste,1
"While the price range is good, and the RAM and ROM good .. it has some huge glitches.
Wish Xiaomi would fix those before releasing it early.
To begin with, the phone mostly doesn't recognise your existing SIM card. While it works with my other phone, the SIM doesn't work on this.
Then I had to update the software, and 1 of the SIM card is working, and the second is not - which is quite frustrating. The MI service centre says that the SIM card is damaged. How can that be when it worked with my previous phone.
There are lots of issues related to this online (which I didn't see before).

Its quite frustrating to have traded in my old phone for this, as I need to get a new SIM card for my second one.",3
"I was quite skeptical before buying this product for one and one train only, the notch. I thought it was too big for my taste. But after I started using it, I realised that I and not at all bothered by it. Actually I don't notice it at all.  The windows of any program doesn't open around the notch unless you zoom it.  So there you are.

Rest everything is top class. You all know the interiors of this phone so I will simply skip to the camera. Top class picture quality. And if you use Google camera then the quality just goes through the roof.",5
"I brought this Poco F1 just because i wanted a phone with good processor and memory. Believe me except a good RAM and Memory this phone got nothing..

I tried to replace this product with Amazon but guess what it got canceled automatically. Now this is a liability that I has to take care..",2
"This is not a paid review
This was launched in august 2018 but still i am buying it in 1st october 2019 because this phone is the best in the segment and with snap dragon 845 AI, i got it for 14400 for 6Gb/128gb with discount and this price is awsome. Even with the 17000 ruppee snap dragon 845 is not avilable.
I already bought one poco f1 in 2018 for 19000 6gb/ 64 gb and because of having such good expirence i bought one more. And that too at such a cheap price. This phone is the best in the segment. And kicks ass for all the new phones within 20000 range. The only phone better then this is k20 pro which has Snap dragon 855 which cost around 27000. But both of these have only slight difference.
And after 2 years both a 25 grand phone and a 15 grand phone both have 8000-9000 exchange value to i needed a phone which has value for Money.

The phone handset does not have any physical damage, no mishandling, no liquid damage, but still the MI service centre is reluctant to replace the motherboard and make the phone running again. MI and Micromax phones are the worst I have seen. My previous MI phone Redmi Note 3 also has lots of battery troubles.
People please don't buy MI phones!!",1
Awesome product they provide flagship specifications at moderate price battery life is satisfactory if u r pubg player than this phone is fr u coz performance wise it's simply awesome,4
"Product has manufacturing defect at fingerprint sensor n has  touch issue over display
Thanks for Amazon customer care for giving clear information about returning product
Thanks for Amazon for refunding money within 24hrs",1
"I got this product for 13.7k its totally fantastic
Speed fast charge
Battery backup
Coming to perform no device can beat it in this price range not in this only even under 20k as well
Bcs of its Snapdragon 845 and stock android
This is going to be outstanding",5
"I've been using this phone for 20 days.

This phone is not at all for gamers , it has serious ghost touch issues, game lags a lot, frame drops screen stuttering issues while playing pubg.

Image quality, and colour reproduction from the stock camera app is not at all good but you can install Gcam ,thanks to Camera2Api  support you will Capture decent images with great details and colour reproduction.

Bloatware :- So many useless mi apps , and ads you can't uninstall them and worst part is even after stopping background data and mobile data for these apps, you will still find hell lot of ads in your notification tab. There is no way you can stop them, and they will eat up your ram and mobile data.

Battery although 4000mah, is not up to the mark it drains like anything.

One of the worst displays used on a so called flagship. Most of the devices suffer screen bleeding, mine too. Basically it comes with a display that has a manufacturing defect.

Touch :- one of the worst, as mentioned above it has gost touch issues, touch is so sensitive that even a touch from wires (earphones) works on it. If you put it inside you pocket without locking you might end up making a call or too many apps opening randomly.

Speakers :- best one of the best it is loud and good.",3
"The variant I am using right now is excellent. If you play mobile games, considering the 3900 mah battery and 845 Snapdragon processor, it will last you for 6 to 8 hrs on a single charge. And for a normal user, it will last you a day on a single charge. It is power efficient and has very fast face recognition in low light condition. The fingerprint scanner is also fast at recognizing, only takes milli second to unlock the device.
Charging speed of the device is good, it comes with a 18 w fast charger, which is enough.
0 to 60%  charge in 50 mins
0 to 100% charge in 1hr 35 mins (may vary on user to user) approximate.
The device is sturdy and feels good on hand.
The camera performance needs some tick.
But the sensor used are also good. ( Default Camera software is average).
There is no potrait available in front camera.
Slow motion at 960 fps works in good lighting condition.
It has liquid cooling technology (i wouldn't say it is ideal but it works good).
No headphone/earphone comes in the package.
Considering the price it is right now, can't complain much.
My device scored 347762 antutu benchmark on 19 nov, 2019",5
"I brought this in festival offer so I payed only 14500 Rs/ and I have also revive 1000Rs Casback in Amazon pay..
So I think it was a great deal.
Con's.- 1- Heating issue playing pung or YouTube (40¬∞-43¬∞). its not good because it has cooling system.
 2- battery drain fast. It seems like 3000mah battery.
 3- Build quality is very poor and it has also some touch issue like it respond when earphone wire touch it.
Pros.-1- it has 845 SD so it handle every task very easily, pubg runs very good.
2- camera is very good after installing gcam.
3- fast charging not so fast , it takes to charge full apx (1-2hrs) but comes with type c port.
There are too many thing to buy it and not buy it so if you think that you should buy it then just go for it, Don't think about reviews.",4

PROS
Solid build, no matter if plastic or Kevlar
Great display albeit the notch, excellent contrast and tiny bezels
Snapdragon 845 cooled with copper pipe with vapor chamber
Stereo speakers with excellent loudness and output
Class-leading battery life, quick charge is available
Excellent daylight pictures with the main and selfie cameras
Quality 4K and 1080p video recording
Audio jack, USB-C, FM radio, microSD slot - all present
As cheap as flagships come

CONS
No water-proofing
Mediocre low-light photos due to lack of OIS
No EIS for the 4K videos",5
"GOOD
1. Much better in hand feel (more secure) than S9. Better fingerprint resistance of rear panel. It can actually be used without a case because the Kevlar with not crack on falling.
2. Better performance than S9 (Indian). More RAM, more Storage. Screen is technically inferior to S9 but because it is flat it has less distortions and is easier to protect with tempered glass and less likely to accidentally register a touch, it is actually equal in practice. Best performance below 25000 ( Jan 2020)
3. It has an SD slot and 3.5 mm headphone jack.
4. battery life is much better than the (Indian) S9

BAD
1. battery was TOTALLY discharged on receipt. Which probably will mean it will fail soon after the warranty ends.
2. Camera is below 2020 standards, but ok by 2018 standards.",5

I personally suggest to go for galzedinc tempered glass whis is ultra premium... Superb temp till now....
Bad thing about amazon nd seller is given old stock product which was manufactured on oct of 2018.....i bought this productbon 9 th of this month 2019....
Almost one year old stock....
Amazon really sucks....pls buy this product directly from oggicial website....u l will get new stock of 2019 manufactured date.....
Amazon is cheating their customers......
Go for flipkart or mi official website....

Fell in to trap of Flagship processor and 258gb memory
First week I had multiple problem
Icons were not working, heating issues  concted Amazon customer service. No refund they have advised to hard reset, it started working and again some of the issues cited remain

Think before Buy ..and I see some of my friends also saying redmi mobile are of low quality",3
"The phone is great. I got it for ‚Çπ12995 after exchanging with one plus 2 excluding the ‚Çπ1000 amazon pay cashback. Camera quality after installing GCam mod is amazing. And there is nothing much I can especially say about performance as the phone speaks for itself. I have joined the telegram group and installed a port of OxygenOS. After that, it's just buttery smooth and snappy. Believe me! OxygenOS port is better than MIUI period.",5
"For 15999/- this device is a bargain for a Snapdragon 845 Flagship SoC.
6GB ram and 128GB storage is more than sufficient for my dad's usage.
The camera's are good and adequate and great for the price.
The fingerprint reader is snappy and fast.
The screen is bright enough and feels responsive.
The battery lasts for more than a day and recharges quite fast.
For anyone looking for a budget flagship and can't afford a Oneplus this is a great option.
Will recommend.
Will update after long term usage.",5
"Got for the best price in the festival sale. Got a total of Rs5600 off.

SD 845, 6GB Ram. I need not tell you more about the performance. Number says it all. And it's the main reason it's still a good buy in mid 2019.

Battery is realy good. I got 1day 12hrs battery backup with 7hrs screen on time from 100%to21% battery drain with average to normal usage.(Have not tested gaming yet.)

Notch display is something I don't like. Too much curves at the corners is also a negative point.

Camera is good, and with gcam installed everything got better. Mid 2019 offer better camera specs at even lower price range.",5
"This phone's a beast, no lag, no heating issues. If you are coming from an AMOLED display, you might find the screen quality okayish. Install GCAM and the camera quality goes from okayish to flagship grade. I compared capture quality of both POCO F1 (GCAM) and Redmi Note 7 (Stock) and POCO F1 just blows away Note 7's 48 MP camera.

Pros:-
- Snapdragon 845/ Ultra fast for gaming
- No heating or lagging issues / Liquid cooling
- IR face unlock
- Battery easily last for a day on heavy use
- Stereo Speakers, the audio quality is decent and it's very loud, you eliminate the need of small bluetooth speaker.
- Durable (Polycarbonate back)
- Cameras are mind blowing (with GCAM build)
- Great development support, you can find ample of custom roms and support on XDA.
- Excellent software support from POCO team (they actually listen to customer feedback)
- 500 nits brightness, you can easily use phone under bright sunlight

Cons:-
- Stock Camera app is okayish
- Design is not that great as it does not have a Glass back. (If looks matter to you don't buy this phone)
- Bottom chin is large, corners are rounded and notch is large.
- LCD display
- the design is a little outdated for 2019

If you want raw performance and durability, you cannot find a better buy at this price point currently. Best price to performance. Even after more than a year, this device is a beast.",5
I bought this phone in red color and it looks amazing battery also stays for a long time camera quality is second best in my house first is of my father's one plus 6t overall i like it but there's just one problem its been this phone only 2 months ago but it already hangs sometimes really badly.,4
"Plz. don't fall into the fancy and automatically created reviews about the Poco Phone. I am using this phone for Six months...let me tell all the cons of it..

The cheap materials are used in it..

The company tells that there is a cooling system in it. Biggest lie they have ever told. Not only that it's over heated every now and the....My phone has even bulged out due to the heat...at times I am afraid whether the phone get blasted..Even when I type this message it's getting over heated....

Regarding the camera. If you want a good camera phone plz. Go for the companies like HTC, Samsung, Apple etc. As you zoom in your photos taken in Poco F1 phone you can notice that the photos are like the cartoons just a mixture of some colours. And no clarity.....

Though the battery claimed to be of 4000 mh, it's like the 2000 mh....it drains so fast.....

Dear friends don't be preys of this cheap product. Only advantage in this phone is that there can be some good features, but the phone is of the low quality materials......Go for bit higher prize phones which won't disappoint you....",1
there was a network issue in this phone all sim internet speed is very low,1
"Amazing phone.
It's for gaming. Screen size is good and 60 fps gaming.

Let's see the pros-
1. Processor is awesome, SD 845, so if you know about processor, it is still a beast. It is better than SD 730.
2. GPU is A630 which is also great for gaming. You can game easily on 1080p.
3. Camera is not much great when you zoom in, but it does not affect me because I brought for gaming and other hardcore work.
4. Battery life is also great.
5. Charge speed is good. 0 to 100 in 1hour 35 min.
6. Screen is very responsive. Some post says that you can't play 4 finger claw in pubg, but my phone is working fine and no trouble.
7. If you are gamer and don't use the phone other than gaming, then it is for you. You can game on 60 fps and 1080p (FHD).

So the phone is recommended if you are a gamer and if you are a photographer then go for other smartphone.",5
"Really like specs of this phone at this budget pricing. Got it for (13399= 15999-1000 amazon pay balance -1600 bank discount)
Processor : last year flagship processor 845 (in 13.5 grand )
Battery : last all day with medium to heavy use via calls and Internet
Build quality : would say it is decent may be a notch or two lower compared to one plus build but really good.

I have learnt one thing with phones, wait for a year or 15 months and you get really good specs in budget pricing.",5
"I am using the 6gb ram 128gb memory which i bought it for inr 2.4k just after the launched. For a heavy gamer i thought of buying new phone, i didn't find any for my purpose but this only, I would say that for 1.9k it is the greatest phone for a heavy gamer. Thank you.",5
"This is the 4th poco f1 phone in our family. Couldn't find a phone better than this which is value for money and with excellent specifications in this price point, even after 2 years of its launch. So when i had to buy a new phone for another family member this was the obvious choice. So now 4 of us in the family have this handset",5
"Excellent phone with a flagship powerful processor. Whether it is performance, front and rear camera quality, audio quality in earphones or speakers it is simply awesome. Much has been spoken about the build quality but as per my experience the polycarbonate back is not premium but it is good in quality. A good quality back cover and you are good to go. The 6GB 128 GB is a steal at its price. In the great Indian sale of Oct 2019 I got it for effective price of Rs 13,400/- which is simply awesome.",5
"I have purchased many phones from Amazon and these worked all fine but now I bought a Xiomi POCO F1 on 19 January, 2020. As per specs it is one of the best smart phones available. But within Just 20 days of use, the phone is behaving most erratically, in the following areas:

1. The volume software suddenly becomes active itself and keeps on going up and down, creating havoc on the music played.

2. Many apps suddenly hang and stop.

3. I have not been able to configure my compass. The moment I go to this app, it stops. It has happened numerous times.

4. The camera was functioning nicely, now whenever I am recording a song on Smule, it would turn bright and dark many times during the recording.

If it is behaving so in just 20 days, I am just thinking abt the the worst scenario after a couple of months.

Surprising fact is that Amazon has,a Return window of just 10 days, which is really Shocking...

I would request Amazon to urgently replace my phone with a new phone.",1
"I had ordered POCO-F1 mobile manufactured by Xiaomi  for Rs 14999/- through Amazon app  and was received today morning .

Immediately I visited the Xiaomi  customer care centre at Sector- 14 in Faridabad.
Their technical person tested the product and found the charging point in the mobile slot is not working therefore told that it needs to be replaced .When I told him that being defective piece you replace it with a new one .He politely told me that since you have purchased from Amazon , they will get it replaced .

This phone is hands down the best damn phone ever. People complaining about camera performance can easily download Google cam and see the difference. Processor and gpu are very strong and can easily handle apps of 2020 and even 2021. Fir gaming also this phone is very good. The new Snapdragon 730G is not good as 845 in gaming due to the fact that 730G has adreno 618 Gpu and Snapdragon 845 has adreno 640 gpu. You will extreme (60) fps setting in pubg in poco f1 whereas you'll get ultra (45) fps setting in 730G phones. Built quality of armoured edition is very good,5
"In just one year of launch Poco f1 prices have been dramatically discounted ! Who else does this unless their is something hidden behind this price cut . Guys whichever model you buy they are clearing old stock and this phone has serious hardware /software problem of touch , screen bleeding these are real issue you will face , camera is good for closeup shots ! Battery life good",3
"Hesitant to buy earlier but got really good price.Battery life fantastic ...performance lobed it but camera is outstanding...
Now as this phone is already old interns of launch date...wait for some time and buy poco f2...",5
"The display doesn't feel smooth at all, even compared to my Redmi 3S Prime from 4 years back, it has a sticky feel to it. You're very likely to get stuck while scrolling up or down, or even swiping left or right on the home screen. Occasionally the touch does not register, and i don't even have dry hands. Furthermore, the box wasn't in a very good condition when i received it, it has scratches, dents and pencil marks over it. I got the Armoured Edition(8+256 GB) variant. Everything works fine performance-wise, handles all mainstream games with ease, the UI is fast enough. You can make the most out of the camera by downloading GCAM. I'm probably gonna return/replace it.",3
"Don't follow you tube video to judge, camera bogus, head phone sound worst, phone is fast, display good",3
Its awesome . great camera quality . only drawback it had is its battery life. It gets drained in a day,5
"Review after 1 week.
Cons:
Battery life is not good even with MIUI11, my old note 5 pro is better than this. Most apps are crashing. Banking apps are not working properly with fingerprint sensor (Fingerprint failed error always). Full screen/landscape apps/games not fitting properly. Updater can't download latest package manually. Notification icons area is a mess. Low sound/audio for calls/media compare with note 5 pro.
Pros:
Excellent processor for multitasking/games. No heat observed while playing games. Fast charging is worthy and quick.",2
"¬†Totally disappointed with the the package. While purchasing it was mentioned that the package include Headset, adapter, Usb type C cable, sim eject tool, user guide, warranty card, clear soft case. But the headset was missing in the package.",1
"Pros : The price for which you get Snapdragon SoC 845

Cons: 1) absolutely rubbish battery backup.
2) pathetic camera performance in low light or if u r inside room .
3) sound is just like a 2g phone speaker you won't be able to articulate n collect what the other person said behind the next line.
4) screen is extremely fragile , one bump from 3 ft that's your pocket height and ur screen drems will be shattered in prices. Absolutely no front glass protection. Gorilla went back to save his girlfriend i think leaving behind ur price specific budget phone. Even ur cover or bumpcase might not save it . Better keep it in hand or in a bank locker.
5) Heats up like a iron wen u play ping even for 20 mins and battery reduces to 50 % in just 30 mins .

All in all a major hole in ur pocket .never buy this phone .
Amazon customer support is lousy and pathetic cancelled my return pick up and refund 5 times till now.",1
"People who are thinking even today that if they should purchase POCO F1 or not, they should go for it since it is a value for money product. Be it's custom ROM support, camera or gaming, it will not disappoint you although it cannot be as good as OnePlus 7/7T product but according to the price segment in which poco f1 is selling, I have no room to complain for the same.

I would recommend this product to all buyers except for the ones who are willing to buy smartphones for flaunting design and higher camera megapixels.",5
"I love the product, but Amazon delivered a defective piece (mfg dt. 1 year old) and it decides to restart every now and then. When replacing it, they tell you to install an app and check, which tells you that your phone is working perfectly. This is not the first product I'm facing an issue with AMAZON. At least get good vendors to ship the products from.",1
"After lot of research, I decided to buy poco F1 and bought 8gb+256gb red edition. The phone is really master of speed thanks to Snapdragon 845. The red colour looks very beautiful. The stock camera and gcam both are very good. other phones in this price range are no match.
The phone has a dedicated game turbo mode. Games like call of duty mobile, pubg, asphalt 9 runs smoothly in very high graphic settings. No heating issue. MUST BUY..VERY HIGH VALUE FOR MONEY.",5
"Powerful device with lots of storage and ram. Unfortunately, the battery is poor, and needs recharge in less than a day, even with minimum usage. Found this to be true on 2 different phones (bought one from Amazon and another directly from mi store online). Always carry a powerbank!",3
"I really loved the back cam. And all thr other specs are sincerely woth the every penny spent on it. But the phone i got has an issue with the front cam. I noticed it within 10 days of use. The corners of the images from front cam are appeared to be blurred and really awkward. I tried same fone from the nearest shop and whose front cam was perfect. Since the notice period for return was already got off, dont know what to do now. I cud have got a replacement of the same if was prominent in the first 10 days.",4
"I liked first poco f1 device 8gb Ram so bought second one for family member. That says all about it. Poco F1 armored edition is better than normal edition. The reason I will not disclose because Xiaomi also don't disclose. Both versions are unmatched-great value for money, but the armored is better between the two. Go for it if you can on your own",5
"Battery is defective of this phone
The screen is defective it flickers.
I had raised request. That phone is defective and  to be replaced. In orders it showed will be replaced by 11the I am still waiting for the phone to be replaced. But on 12th it shows window is closed. Also there is no way to call any of u guys. To get the status",1
"Battery life is bit a problem,but still it could easily last a day with heavy usage, camera is the best in the class and segment ,SD 845 is smooth and ram management is amazing , charging speed is approx 1.5 hrs from 10to 100, display is a just a miss.other than that everything is truly perfect in this device.a must buy for a person whose budget is 20k",5
"There is no issue in the poco f1 in battery, Fingerprint & camera quality is also good but I found heating issue when I play PUBG in this smartphone. But I will give single star rating to amazon. Because return and replacement warranty is only to show to the customer. When I found heating issue & little touch issue also in this phone and complain for that and ask for replace the smartphone. But they refused to replace and said that if you play game it will heat. Not get any solution. This is my first and last shopping from amazon.

Thankyou Amazon",1
"Bought this phone at 15999. I dont care about generation of the model, just bought this for powerful ram, processor and memory. Mi ui has some problem except that it is superfabulous. I recommend one should buy this at such lower price. This is little heavy making some of the light humans to carry it difficult. Its advantages outweights the disadvantages. And since it is Redmi brand, I trust them in there economy editions. Best things needs to be done with Best things. Finally I have got 1000 amazon pay reward which means I bought this at 14999. Thanks amazon too. One thing I noticed is they dont highlight type of battery. I have got a Li ion which of course has less ratings compared with Li Polymer. Which truely makes sense if you are more interested in the electrical aspects of this phone. Coming to its camera it is not worst. But I installed googles g cam which is not available the playstore though. I took some tremendous 360 degree photos as well. The processor is fast with its liquid cooling technology. Thanks Xiomi.",4
"Pros -
Processor- 845 SD gives a seamless experience without any lag or any hiccups with the 8 GB RAM support no matter how many apps you run simultaneously. I have added a 128 GB additional card as well yet it runs super fast at this price range .
Camera - great pictures , day or night especially at the right focus point be it or macro shots. Video is also fine stable and clear at light

Cons - stock UI sucks but once customized it works fine",5
"I bought this for 16999 That is great. But when playing PUBG I've faced an issue with touch, irresponsive. That is a bit disgusting. Camera quality above average. I bought this only because of fine developers available for this device. I love pure stock android. So I can install stable customs ROMs. Cam2API supports by default. I'm taking a good amount of quality pictures with GCam.",4
"Honest Review of POCO F1.

Pro- SD845 at rs13500 is just unbeatable. Best processor under 25k.
Battery - good,at least1 day with heavy use
Display- excellent quality IPS display. Colours are more true life colours.
Camera- excellent with GCAM.

Cons-
1. Big notch
2. Build quality- generally we use back over. So it didn't matter to me

Best mobile under 20k.",5
"I received this amazing beast poco f1 within 2 days thanks to amazon. I was having doubt in buying this mobile but its all clear now. The flagship processor is faster than my laptop. The battery life is pretty good as compared to my other phones.  Also the face unlock is super fast compared to any other phones . if u wanna buy it , go for it with eyes closed . great experience.",5
I got a dead phone.after unboxing it does not on.and won't charging.i am feeling totally disappointed .I am so harnesses..I recommend don't buy any electronic gadget from Amazon..,1
"Don't buy phones in amazon.
My poco f1 phone is 6 GB ram 128 GB rom snapdragon 845 CPU  not even running pubg  game smooth graphics ping is going high when I play game for 1 hour its coming to home screen . And amazon not going to replace the phone. Worst replace policy from amazon. They are telling that we are not responsible if phone not runs the game.",1
"Coming from an LG G6, I had issues with the placement of the power button at first. I did however get used to it within 3 days. While I don't hate MIUI, I'm not exactly its biggest fan either. Within the first week Pixel Experience was loaded and then I opted for Evolution X ROM thereafter. Performance has been stellar, install GCam and the camera is quite formidable even by 2020 standards.

The fingerprint reader is super responsive. The face unlock with the IR camera is exclusively a MIUI thing, custom ROMs don't seem to be able to support it.

Battery life is really good. Lasts me an entire day with 4G on constantly.

Screen legibility in sunlight is very good. Not as good as top tier Samsung AMOLEDs but not too bad either.
Notch is is quite annoying for me.

Call clarity is good. Earpiece speaker and main speaker are both very loud.
They do distort at extremely high volume levels though.

Though I've put a case on myself, the armoured edition's texture on the back cover is great and quite grippy.

Gaming is unsurprisingly great.
No frame drops to report of yet.
Gets ever so slightly warm but not too a point where it's unusable.

Storage and RAM is plentiful. RAM management is great too.

In conclusion :
If you're someone who tinkers often and loves custom ROMs, get this.

If you're not someone who is willing to tinker around, opt for something newer like a Note 8 Pro, Poco X2 or Realme X2.",5
"I had brought this product on big billion day. I got a very bad gaming experience. The game graphics is high and screen frame rate is also good,bt the during the gameplay screen stuck it's through out the gaming it's very disappointing. And also my audio jack is complaint on the 5th day of purchase. Quality is very low.",1
"Main Camera could be little improved. Else, this phone beats all phones having range of 10-20k.

Quick charging , Android 10 upgrade, great speaker sound, Full HD display with 402 ppi. Great storage and RAM, no lagging, LED light notification, great front camera, 1 full day of battery life after heavy use etc are the features of this phone.

Best choice to buy under 20k range.",5
Receive POCO F1 ON 19 th March 2020. Phone is outometically shutdown during call and Battery is taking much time to charge.I have even updated all available version and checked the phone through BLANCCO App as per instruction and showing ok but still phone has started heating Nd battery is not charging properly.Custommer care ifAmazon has given complain no. 4739 and to old that service team will call but no one had called. Very disappointed that Amazom had started marketing such a sub standard products.,1
"the touch screen is super senstive that if our earphone wire rolls over the screen, there will be activity happening on phone. the battery life is ok, but it gets charged pretty quickly. Better game play, but I found issue when listening to songs with wired earphones while walking any slight movement of connection for audio jack would pause the song, the screen will on inside our pocket as it would change songs due to movement of our legs while walking",4

~ in 3 months the magnetic sensor, accelerometer and  gyroscope stopped working (attached screenshots). bcoz of that compass is not working. i can't get realtime directions in google maps.
many people had the same issue.
do some research before buying.",1
This is a perfect mobile for PubG types of games at the price range of 15K. Camera also premium. 4K Recording at 60fps is amazing. I suggest everybody to purchase this mobile. Don't go with 48 or 64 megapixel mobiles. There is no benefit of 48 or 64 mp camera. The image quality is same but takes more space of your mobile.,5
Dont buy guys.There is a big issue here especially if you are a gamer.I bought this mobile for playing pubg but it has a big touch issue.You could search in the google too you will see the problem about touch problem and xiaomi is not fixing it till now so dont buy.you will regret it. I want to return it but their is not returning option.Replacing wont give me any help so i didnt replace it . It took me hours to fine solution but it didnt help üò≠,1
"¬†I ordered a POCO F1 on 21/01/2020 as it was claimed that its camera was very good but you know what I received on 23/01/2020??? A handset with a dysfunctional cameras. The handset had a serious manufacturing defect in the form of a hardware issue with the motherboard itself. As you all know, motherboard is the brain/heart of the mobile phone and that itself was faulty. These are the kind of products released to the market by Mi (Xiaomi) without any quality check & testing and blindly delivered by Amazon to its customers.
I ordered a replacement for this defective/faulty handset and I am yet to receive the same till date (23/02/2020)...
Mi (Xiaomi) customer service is pathetic and Amazon is bad too w.r.t. its customer service standard.",1
Everything is great about the phone...no issues faced during the transportation phase as the device got delivered to me well within the promised delivery deadline..but one thing that is bugging me is that the device I received was manufactured during the month of October nd the year was 2018...which is kind of old..although that doesn't seems to be causing trouble in anyway..but I want to ask the seller about why he/she didn't sent me a newer unit..?? Did Xiaomi stopped the production??,5
"Fortunate Enough...
I booked on 30.09.19 and got delivery on 02.10.19. Its a flagship phone so i decided to buy it even in 2019 with the effective offer (15999-1600DebitCardPayment-1000 Amazon PayCash Back = 13399/-.

POCO F1 performance is good just like i watche reviewe. Its going well with this phone, but unfortunately on 19.10.19 just after 17days, it switched off permanently. Then i went MI CARE... they examinied and told : this is motherboard issue and they replaced it free of cost. Thanks to #mi care.

Now my phone is running well.",4
"Awsom product,  good memory,  stunning speed, some improvement in display.  The company told that quick charging.  But i don't feeling quick charge.",5
Giving this review after using 90 days. Screen is not upto the mark. Some touch issues whil pubge claw. Graphic rendering is far better than any 20k smartphone. Camera is good enough to make u feel good according to the price and other specs. Built quility is avarage. Battery and changing is impressive. A whole day useing device for moderate user. 4 hrs of Pubg at smooth+extreme. Don't expect more if u spend 15k. If u are thinking about a real flagship sell your kidneys.üòÇüòÇüòÇ,5
"I brought this phone only for pubg because of Snapdragon 845 at 15k, but the phone touch is so much sensitive, hence you need to put extra efforts while playing pubg. Also the phone heated too much while playing pubg. You need to switch on the fan or AC to get constant 60 FOS otherwise frame rate drop due to excess heating. If you are gamer and have low budget then you can buy this phone. Please note this phone does not support online streaming device and frame rate drops when you try to record your gameplay. For better gaming experience you can go for one plus or iphone devices",3

"I will tell u one thing after using of 1 month ,see amazon is selling some defective products so be aware of that before any product k so my intention to tell that is go for new released phone so that they can give old phones and also used phones",5
"Very fast delivery orderd night 10 o clock got delivered next day 9am
About mobile ..... Super mobile i dont mind the outlook of mobile. I mind only performance great battery life. Very happpy with the purchase",5
Everything is ok but rear camera is not working properly. They clicked blur pictures. Camera was damaged,1
It's an awesome mobile for the price. But the only drawback that matter to me was the screen bleeding at the chin of the display. The device sent to me was manufactured in Oct 2018. Old stock for an order made during festival sale in Oct 2019. So had to return the product because the issue was clearly noticable at many instances. Other than that it was a great phone for the unbelievable price.,3
"On 7th day itself i noticed dust in from camera. I mean it was just 7 days old phone. Showed it to a friend who works at apple he suggested it might be an refurbished one or the screen is repaired thats how i got this one cheap. 15999 was tha price i got it for. Never expected this from Mi.

Also my friend‚Äôs Poco F1 screen broken When dropped from just 3 ft table height.... processor looks camera is way better than any other phone in this range but display is only glass without any protection and tha camera dust thing is there as well...",2
"Oh god this mobile is beast, battery mentioned is 4000 mAH, but it's way more long lasting. Plus its liquid cooling system made it a powerful device with any heat issue. Camera quality is so dam clear, I don't care what megapixel it is anymore. To be very honest, I  bought this smartphone on the basis of its latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 which gives a clock speed of 2.8 GHz. This is more than enough for intense gaming. But after a week of its usage I found other cool stuffs too. Like I already told  its battery is powerful. Even though it is 4000 mAH but the liquid cooling system makes it beyond the limits. U know what? this phone should cost more than 23000 INR but I got it for mere 13K. This is my one of the genuine review till date in shopping from Amazon history.",5
"There is nothing to complain about this phone other than the huge notch on the top. If you can ignore it then I bet POCO F1 is a show topper in every aspect. Throw it any game it will run at ease without over heating, thanks to its liquid cooling technique.

The Snapdragon 845 perform pretty well as it keeps running and helps in switching applications easily.

And the mammoth battery life keeps the juice flowing whole day with 3-4 complete match in PuBG as well as COD.",5
"Wow wow wow
What a mind blowing phone
Nothing to say...
You really loves it...when to take
Everything camera saying 12 megapixel but its more than 64
Graphics in pubg call of duty...
More than expected...

I am satisfied but After the 2 month hitting issue while playing pubg  in just 4 match 1.5 hour that why ptice drop by 2k think before buying.,5
"ACTUALLY buyed this phone for playing pubg onlyüòÇ. Pubg runs superbly smooth. 60FPS No Lag. It's really good for gaming. Camera is also nice if your face is Beautiful. And the phone is charged very quickly like 100% in 1 & half hour.

Camera - on a scale of 10 is 6.5 points.

Conclusion - It is a good go product.",4
"Received this device on 6th Oct! Brought it for 13.4k and it's a beast at this price and still worthy to buy despite being more than one year old! Pubg runs extremely well with no lag and some framedrops during hotdrop! 845 SOC at this price is unbelievable!

Fingerprint sensor is lighting fast! The IR face unlock is the most underrated feature on this device! It's detects more accurately and unlocks device in total darkness without any failure!

Pubg can run straight for 5 to 6 hrs non stop with full charge! And it takes 1hr 30muns approx to completely charge it.

Camera quality is possibly still the best at this price! JUST CHECK THAT NIGHT VISION PICTURE! AWESOME",4
"Hardware and functioning 100%

Better than every other phone under 20,000-25,000",5
"Only 2 things I didn't like about this mobile are it's big ass notch on the screen and worst cover we get inside box.
Sometimes network issues happen even though full network is displayed on screen - Not sure if the problem is from service provider or mobile.
It lagged but very rarely.
Performance is pretty good for daily usage which includes gaming as well (Not a hardcore gamer).
I hardly got any heating issues.
Build quality is good, since many times it has fallen from pocket and ear height. Then also no damage so far (I use cover as well).
Camera quality is pretty decent.
Battery stays till full one day and happy with the fast charger which came with the box. It takes only 1.5 hrs to full charge.
Nice value for money phone. Overall-4.7/5.0",5

"To be honest really impressed with poco f1. Its been 2 months since I started using this phone. To everyone who confuse to buy poco f1 vs all mobile phone I would say you can go this phone because it has snapdragon 845 chipset, till now this phone doesn't slow down or any lag. Its completely lag free & you can install high size app games etc without lag free doubt. 6 gb ram & 128 GB storage is more then enough. I brought it for 15k & its worth. Please don't buy any other phone just because triple camera & fancy display because those phone not build by high end chipset like snapdragon 845. These kinda chip set only can be found mobile which cost above 28k. I'm wiring this review on 2020 by this time only one phone which has snapdragon 845 chipset in 15k price range. Thanks for reading my feedback & if its helps please tumbs up so many people can see it ‚úåüèª",5
"Poco F1 is good mobile I have purchased for Rs14999 if you want a good and premium Chipset of 845 you can go for it if  your budget is for mid range phones, for gaming it's a legend in this segment and camera performance is good after Poco x2 release also I have purchased F1 only",5
"This phone is somewhat good but there are two major issues which every poco users face.
1. Front camera won't work properly after 3-4 months or may be within 1 month. You will be asked to restart the device but it will not solve the issue. I don't understand when and how it fix itself after some hours or days.
2.Flashlight:- The flashlight won't also work along with the front camera. And when the front camera gets fixed ,the flashlight will also start working.
If you google these issues , you will find a lots of complaints regarding the same.",1

"I was using this phone for around two months, In 2019 it is a good buy at ~15k. SD 845 is fast and os experience is lag free.  Although MIUI is not clean, you get lot of customisation options. Battery is good as per 2019 standards one might find not a huge, still you get whole working day with heavy use. Camera is decent considering price it is good, and performance is excellent.",4
Good performance even in 2019.. Got the phone during the October 2019 sale.. The phone I got was manufactured in October 2018.. Gaming performance is good.. Liquid cooling actually works.. Phone battery temperature does not cross 42degree celsius even during gaming...,5
"This phone is mindblowing for what it is offering. Till now(March 2020), the phone has got Android 10( Q) since the fact that the phone was launched with Android 8(Oreo). Though this phone has only 2 back camera, the performance of the camera is very good (excellent with Gcam). Till date it is the beast of performance with SD845.
If someone is thinking that this phone has a big notch, then I tell you that this notch is equipped with IR sensor (like Iphone X series and above) which is worth it.
Though there are various phones available for this price, this phone is for those who believe in solely performance with great camera experience one can go with this phone without any hassle",4
"Single word ""AMAZING"" in all aspects. Got this mobile for just 13k. Miles better than many new mobiles. Can say confidently that its equivalent and competitor to 1+6t",4
"Pros... This mobile is superfast and smooth.... Battery life is ok.. If u play pubg it will go more than 4 hour... In moderate graphics settings.
Cons... This device is too small... Go for note series if you want a moderate sized phone",5
"It is simply unbeatable. The time I bought it was draining battery fast. About 10% in one hour. But after miui 11 update it became 5% per hour.
The build quality is little compromised in terms of gorilla glass in back.
But you have to remember a company is giving SD845 in 15000.
It is really a top product from xiomi",5
"It's been 1 month 5 days and I never had a thought in mind that I shouldn't have bought this phone. It stood on my expectations , bought it on Diwali sale at a price of ‚Çπ15,000
The sd845 with the adreno 630 is amazing
60 fps in all high end games
12+5 mp cam is amazing
The best part is the ir face unlock which is fast and unlocks in less than a sec.
Game turbo amazing
Front cam Amazing
Storage and ram , get it according to ur need
Mine is 6+128 enough

Yes it is a flagship phone and with the features in it it's amazing even after 1 year.

Love Xaomi and my poco f1",5

The previous year flagship killer at this killer price. I could not resist myself. I can't tell you all how am I happy to have this phone. Best phone till now at its price segment. Everything is best. And I have to thanks Appario Retail to send me this phone the next day after my order. Next day delivery by Amazon. I am very happy with this deal. This is now or never deal.,5
"Being a top notch chipset, it is expected to deliver in terms of speed, but the design is very average looking and edges are not well defined. I can see some information being cut as it used to happen in older TV sets. Didn't expect from large manufacturer like Xiaomi.",3
This the worst product. First time I'm getting such an experience from Amazon. The product stopped working within 24 hours. The product is not powering up now. Hope Amazon will help me in sorting out this issue either by replacement or refund.,1
If you want to play high heavy games then best phone for gaming .Pubg experience is really fantastic and you can play HDR with ultra frame rates .you can do live streams in YouTube's .battery life is good .camera quality is really clarity pics you can see.warning please take protection glass or tempered glass.,5
"Got this one at 14400 +1000 amazon cashback.
I was littlebit confused between M30s and Poco F1. But when i got this one, it felt great.
The OS is butter smooth, camera is good , performance is way better and display is also great.
When my friend got his M30s, all he can talk was about his battery life. Poco F1's 1080p LCD display will not disappoint you.",5

The opposite person hears voice breaks when I speak.

The Display and Camera quality are average imo.
Performance wise, the phone is a dream. I decided to retain MIUI due to concerns about not being able to use a few features.",5

Just go for it at this price.",5
Its a good phone but there are many others phones available in this price segment bt if are choosing this phone for gaming go for it snapdragon 845 kills it wherever its go for performance bt if you are looking for a camera phone and a display phone dont go for it choose another one like realme x or realme5 pro,5

I don't think despite being more than a year old there is any product which competes this phone in under 16 K price segment .

Actually it's my second my Poco phone. It's camera is far ahead than 48 mp marketing gimmick camera phones. Surely with time technology changes & same specs getting cheaper. That's why you were getting 29k priced phone at 19k . I like physical fingerprint sensor over on-screen one. It's face unlock works perfectly in low light or could say no-light conditions as well.,5

Camera quality is perfect, finger print reader is superb and face unlock is best in industry it has thermal image sensor can unlock phone in dark also..Superb phone overall",5

But if you're switching from Samsung , Motorola or any other reputed brand then you will find some touch issues as the screen isn't that responsive. But you will adjust to it in a week or two.

Poco f1 is a flagship killer.
Go for it without any second thought.",4

Fingerprint  sensor  at rear side of the phone is quick.. Battery life of the phone is so good 4000 MaH..I bought this phone for Gaming...I play PUBG and COD at HD Graphics and Extreme FPS... Totally the phone is a beast for gamers who are looking for phone at this budget..",5

you can't get any flagship phone of snapdragon 845 at this cheapest range!
also, your head will be up with pride using POCO,

PUBG is running quite smoothly
battery backup is damn good!
also, AnTuTu Benchmark will always be above 300000.

this is your best shot in cheapest range,

"Phone is a beast, gaming is absolutely smooth, but no update for stock camera ( Xiaomi tends to degrade the camera in Poco F1), miui 10 was totally optimised.... don't upgrade to miui11, its buggy. Battery Life detoriated after miui11 update. Overall a good experience after 15 days of power usage. Fingerprint scanner and face unlock is as smooth as it can come. No heating issue after extensive gameplay ( yes for Pubg phone will heat up but still very less compared to other phones). It might not look premium but  it's quite handy and you definitely got to feel the power in your hand.",5

Performance is one area where the Pocophone F1 glitters. The phone is driven by Qualcomm‚Äôs 2018 star attraction, Snapdragon 845 chipset, which gets a wingman in Andreno 630 GPU. For sustained performance, the F1 also houses a 6GB / 8GB RAM option and up to 256GB UFS 2.1 storage.",5

"After a lot of research bought this phone which is like Ferrari of smart phones. Overall decent performance in every category. Noise reception, camera, operating system, face and fingerprint lock, Speed is the essence here. You will nit regret mark my words. Only one thing to suggest too Xiomi I.e. increase battery capacity to 6000 mAH as battery consumption is more on video play. Though battery lasts for a day with video usage of 2.5 hours + GPS on + 4G connectivity on continuously.",5
"Everything about this device is great. If I am too nit pick the cons are lcd ips display ( instead of an amoled panel which few budgetphones in 2019 do offer) and there notch ( but it has an infrared camera in the front to enable face unlock even in pitch darkness)...
Mind that Android 10 would have dark mode and amoled screen would be better for it..
Otherwise this is the best phone
I bought it for 13400 (6 : 128gb)",5
"It‚Äôs a fabulous phone with fantastic camera and good battery life.
With 6gb ram and 128 gb space it‚Äôs worth each penny spent. Loved it",5
"Nice product, looking to buy this from several months but was always out of budget. Got good deal, cashback, exchange bonus etc.. bought 128gb in 15k. Superb performance. Best buy in price.",5
"The phone is brilliant but there is a only problem I am facing during playing pubg mobile is that the your palm touches the notch area and due to that the player moves automatically and some times stopes moving

But this is not a touch issue you can fix it by using a bumper case .",5
"Excellent performance, and also build quality is nice use ringke fusion x back case and make it look premium, use g-cam v7 for better camera experience and astrophotography, 15000 is better price for this phone, value for money, fastest fingerprint sensor, good battery life, world's fastest face unlock üîìüîì
My choice is pocophone in the price under 20k in the end of 2019,

Successfully completed first anniversary pocophone",5
"First I would like to say that sd845 is still a good option to play games like pubg on extreme frame rates,  gcam is quite impressive for taking night photos, I won't say that there isn't any lag but still 10 times better than other competitors.",4
"This phone is just amazing.
But i have noticed two issues
1.This phone was manufactured in 2018 not in 2019
2.Android version is 8.0(As per the description in amazon it is 9.0) which also disappointed me
otherwise this phone is super
Delivery was very fast(2days) and the packing was also good",5
"I ordered it on the mega sale event and got it for 13,500.,mobile is mind blowing  super fast and all department is good. Camera,battery,sound,speed ,UI etc. But Amazon gave me 1 year old packed piece(2018 Oct). Thats the worrying thing,because I have to use it for a long time, so i expected a newely manufactured pieces. Some con's: Touch its not that much sensitive, some Bluffy sound hears from screen while figure touches the display. And Speaker holes is looks dummy, only one side speaker holes is working.",5
"Excellent phone for lovers who wants performance. Operates at lighting speed. Especially the fingerprint sensor response is too good. Good value for money. Only drawback is its bit heavy (not too much) compared to Samsung/vivo otherwise it's a cool gadget. No second thought, just buy it",5
It's a great device for gaming.... Especially for gyroscope pubg players. It has got some touch delays and touch errors....So I wouldn't recommend this phone for non-gyro players...Overall performance is great though....On smooth settings it runs around 45-60fps easily...with the maximum stability of 58 - 60.,4
"¬†I GOT THIS PHONE FROM AMAZON TO GIFT MY FRIEND, ITS SO EMBARRASSING AS MY FRIEND CALLED ONE DAY SAYING THERE IS PROBLEM WITH PHONE 2 MONTH BACK I GOT IT ON EMI........PEOPLE YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING REGARDING THIS PHONE AS ITS VERY BAD EXPERIENCE.........PHONE IS GETTING SLOW, GETTING HEATED UP AND SOME DIFFERENT MARK HAS COME ON SCREE.....AND IT HAS NOT FALLEN THERE IS NO SINGLE DROP MARK..................ITS PROBLEM FROM INSIDE......FRUSTRATING",1
"This is my first Xiaomi Smartphone THE POCO PHONE and i love it it is fast, good battery life, not at all heats up liquid cooling is working perfectly i too got mfg date nov 2018 but i don't care as it is working perfectly fine. I recommend this smartphone.",5
"I took this mobile mostly for gaming like pubg etc.the movement icon in pubg is out of my control many times,and touch not working at that moment and its movement is controlled by itself.the movement is moving even when I touch or slide on firing icon.its happening repeatedly.but outside the game ,phone is good,but I took it for game .so I am frustrated abt this happening for brand new mobile.my friend bought same phone but he does nt have any problem with it",3
"I am giving this review after using this phone for over five weeks.Phone is really good performance wise,stated by taking into consideration of games like pubg , cod mobile, shadow fight 2.camera is good but when it comes to zooming picture looses its clarity very badly, battery is great and there's no heating issue till now .",5
I was sceptical about camera hardware but after installing Google camera it has exceeded my expectations. Definitely cannot compete with pixel phone but the camera gap is very marginal. May be in next major update I.e aka Poco F2 we may see it neck to neck. OnePlus should really take this consideration seriously.,4
"The phone as lots of issues coming such as blinding screen and the phone as getting slower nd hanging problem I buy this phone resendly 2months ago nd this hanging problem iss coming too much please consider my problem nd give me a new poco phone.....
Thanking you,
Ronak Mayekar",2
"Totally its good.
Camera is impressive.
Touch screen is sensitive.
Battery life is short.
Cannot use mobile 24 hours even in full charge
High price, no yield for that amount",3
"Superb
......
Great camera...
Good performance
Good features
Btry 4k fast charging
Grt processer
Simply fab...!!
....value for money
I bought it for 14k
Feeling greatful really...thanks to Amazon",5
Excellent product from xiaomi.camera quality is good but not up to mark like latest launched products.Fingerprint sensor is very fast.Battery life is average not so good.Overall product is justified it's Price.,5
My charger was defeated. It burn after 10-15 minutes. Camera is very good and I got 241gb space out of 256 the phone is good. I request company to change my charger because it's has 6 months warranty.,3
Cannot say it's new or a refurbished one... I have tried everything even had a chat with xiaomi but no luck.. There is no way to register or to check warranty online.... It's just verifies the model I have.,3
"Awesome..!
Better Performance with SD845, Fastest Face unlock much better then newly comers devices. Fastest fingerprint sensor too..!
Better Gaming (Asphalt 9- everyday) with Game Turbo 2.0 technology.
Even cooler when long running the games.
6 GB RAM+128 GB ROM.
This is lower price in all this performance.",5
"I bought it in the Mi fest at 21000/-
The best things i felt were fast fingering sensor and the face unlock is blazing fast which even works in the extreme dark/zero light.  The screen is good for outdoor use also. But the notch is very big.  The MIUI makes the phone very handy to use. The processor is blazing fast. Battery backup depreciated within 3 months of usage",5
"Front camera is been worst, imazes are blurred due to dust had gone inside. New phone has dust inside the camera . how to belive it. Worst things are happening in online do not buy it.",1
Very old phone. Amazon is cheating it‚Äôs customers by supplying old phones. Phone was supplied with tempered glass which indicates that it is an old and used phone. The battery was already dead when it was switched on for the first time.,1
Every thing is extraordinary except one thing. BATTERY draining very fast when compared with Samsung m30 . Both the mobile are very new one and i got in same day delivery,4
"Actually some times
The screen don't work so don't buy after 2020",4
"They delivered defective product , the phone battery is dead when deliver and when I charged and used for a while it turned off again and never turned on. Phone started heating even it's off, I requested for replacement this big billon day offers are worst products please beware",1
"This product is a defective , software also not support to 256 GB , hanged mobile , not suitable above 64 GB memory , please check my mobile and amount deposit in Amazon pay",1
"Great camera and detailing
IR face reader (not so common)
Big battery (at least for me)
Smooth UI
Best processor in that range... Others dont even stand close considering the performance... You know SD845 :D
Smooth touchscreen
Fast fingerprint reader

Overall MUST BUY for any user
Don't go for samsung in this range

PS: Got 6+128 variant in 13,400 in Great Indian Festival Sale :P",5
"Hiii....this is a very honest review I must clear at d outset.....
This phone is  a real flagship killer....I had ordered the armored edition...8GB 256 GB storage one....its a fabbbb phone....

I really like this mobile so much this will be the best phone for ever photo clarity is awesome I give five üåü for this mobile love you Poco F1üòòüòòüòòüòò,5
Dash charging must be there. Overall a good phone. There is IR blaster but no remote functionality it is used only for face unlock.,5
"Honest review :-

1. Amazing Speed
2. Super fast face scan ( in total dark )
3. Awesome screen quality
4. No screen bleeding issue
5. Camera quality is also too good
6. Decent battery backup",5
"The build quality is not that premium but as I got the 6,128 gb variant in just 13.4k so I can't really complaint about it.
The processer to cameras to sensors to UI feel everything is fantastic.
So basically poco f1 is the Brock Lesnar of mid range smartphones section.",4
"Buyed for 13.4k best price
Everything running
battery life SOT 8hrs with gaming on non updated oreo rom... Lets see whats happens if i update to pie!
battery life is same after updating to pie!",5
"Awesome üì∑ with gcam, awesome performance, awesome battery, perfect size, aur kya chahiye. Best mobile under 2k, i got it at 10,000 with exchange and cashback and sbi card. Paisa vasul.",5
"The product is great by itself but this handset does not allow me to locally manage my data between the PC and the device and hence I‚Äôm unable to transfer my data to the phone and use it.

I strongly suggest Amazon to make a note while selling that Xiaomi phones are incapable of local data transfers and allow the customers to choose whether they would like buy such a product or not.",1
"The Feedback is good as this was bought for someone, as a Gift. They love it!",5
"Good choice at better price for the ultimate configuration...
Amazon delivery is also excellent...
Offer is not coming frequently...I bought poco f1 8 GB ram, 256 GB memory for rs.15144 without any exchange...waiting for the same deal for one more additional qty...",5
"All the features are good, didnt experienced heating issue, battery life is good, minimum 1 day, you can feel the processor and ram doing their part for smooth and fastness. Camera is nice but not the best",5
"Nice but killer one in 2019 also
There is no phone who can beat Poco fi under 20k so my suggestion it's is üòäüíØüëåüëåüëå because I have 8 gb ram with 256 gb killerü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©",5
"The phone looks cool, batter and camera is good. Touch doesn't work properly some time when we keep the finger close also it takes as touch. During the call if we keep the phone near ear touch dont activate thats good if any application is open then the screen stays there and accidentally ear touches the call gets disconnect.
speed of the phone also not as expected even though i don't use for games.",2
"Bought 6+128 in sale. 15999 was Price, 10% extra discount on SBI card payment, so cost was reduced to 14636. With extra 1000 rupees cashback on amazon. Its a steal.",5
The phone heats up over 50 degree celsius when i'm playing any battery intensive games... and its not like after playing for like 30 mins or something.. it gets heated within 5 mins.... I'm definitely not satisfied with the phone... I've done resets both hard and soft and called up customer care for replacement(who don't really care) in vain... overall experience would be in negative if negative numbers were allowed...,1
"It's a beast... A BEAST....!!!!!
Don't think much.. go for it..
Camera may be 12MP but it got the sharpness and clarity as better as 48MP cams.
Just go for it if u prefer for processing and gaming in budget. Goo.......",5
"Not good. Screen become feded some time suddenly, also Nov 18 product sold by the company in Nov 19. Very  disappointed üòû",2
"finger print is superfast, camera quality is best in the price- its better then samsung galaxy m30s which is 48 mp triple cmera both in clarity and color rendering. battery life is not good of the particular unit i have recieved from amazon because the unit that i have recieved is 1 year old.",5
"This phone is killer flagship phone no doubt on speed. Gaming performance is the best in this ,no one has such a hard performance like poco under the range of 18000 rupees.camera and battery are also good. I got this in offer period in 14400 rupees through online payment plus 1000  cashback in amazon pay balance . i bought 6gb 128 gb variant",5
"Poor battery life seems defective products. Too much heating during charging.

Connected with customer service team no response till today.",1
Poco F1 was completely awesome phone which I have ever used. The photo clarity is excellent as compared to other MI phones. Processor is meant to be perfect part in the whole device. Good looking device appearance. Nothing to say bad about the phone,5
"Fastest finger print at cheapest price, 4000mAh battery is enough for moderate user and Poco Phone comes with 18w Fast charger who charges it 0 to 100% in approximately 1 and half hour I got the 6GB 128GB variant at just ‚Çπ14399 in Great Indian Festival Sale on SBI Card discount MRP ‚Çπ15999 on sale also Beat for Gaming in comparison with Redmi Note 8 pro",5
"Minus one star for camera
camera is bad is not bad at start but it's quality is getting worse after every update
I think xiaomi is deliberately making camera worst for their Redmi note series",4
"Honest Review:
The Product has some serious issues of auto functioning. The mobile wake up without receiving any notification sometimes. Also while using earphones touch starts working automatically.",1
"At 15000‚Çπ The phone is a beauty! SD845 is still powerful than any other device in this price range. With the latest MIUI11, it's the best buy. The red color looks dope.",5
"Giving review after using 10 day and just wanna say that it's more than awesome!
Camera+battery life+finger reader+fast face unlock everything is more than good.
I juts love this poco F1.
Highly recommend for the person who love phone photography!",5
In my mobile proximate sensor not working properly just 7days old mobile they are not responding anything for that I don't know what to do waste of money,2
The keyboard is a very big pain in this phone. It is unable to keep up with the normal typing speed and types out wrong spellings for almost every third word.,2
"Battery backup is not that good, but yes it charges very quickly. But still a very good mobile to use.",4
Screen is defected touch problem and sometimes when u call someone u cannot charge your phone worst experience,1
"Well first of all, it is the most affordable flagship till date and though the build quality is a little bit old, it still rocks!

Getting a stable update, UI is awesome, and the display is smoother than i can imagine. Gaming experience is also extremely great.

If you want a flagship phone and low on budget, this is your go to phone...",5
Major touch issues during gaming and lag as well heating problems,1
After usase of  one week bettary is draining.. In invoice its showing price is Rs.0000 what I heard from the reviews not happy with this item dont buy any product from .Amazon /Appario Retail Private Ltd....,1
This is the best phone available in the country at 15k.. camera and processing power is 5 star..however people are not aware of this performance monster phone.,5
"Great indian sale, great purchase, so many phone come and go, but this beast has its own class, it's 845 SD processor, still way better then it's competitive devices, and camera is good for day,night ,even macro shot.
A price drop like this will definitely makes it a great device again.
I bought 6, 128 in just 14000 with my card.",5
"Touch screen glass is of worst quality for Poco F1 mobile and broken on 3rd day of my purchase, never expected such poor quality touch screen glass from MI mobiles.

They would have used gorilla glass and charged more money.",1
"At first i'm sceptical about purchasing this device because of its display and heating issues, but i'm very happy after purchasing the device. The device works flawlessly. it got no issues. go for it, it provides great value for ur money. I haven't seen any cons. Go for it if u r tight on budget (before 2019)",5
It is OK product. Most irritating part id login reminder to MI account. even if you put it off it keeps on popping. Rest phone is OK and quality is good.,3
"Really awesome mobile with that budget, of you compare poco X2 this wins top in all aspects. I have redmi note 8 which is 64 bit camera, F1 comes less resolution. Photo clarity is good when compared with any Android at that budget.

May be it is killer configuration mobile on the market so far with that budget.",5
Worse mobile ever i had.  And worse  service of Amazon.  Will never buy anything from Amazon also will not suggest anyone.  Useless service of amazon,1
"Previously using MI Note 4 which is quite good phone.But POCO does not meet my expectations.Keyboard is worst to type,weight is heavy & it also hangs many times despite of very good RAM.",3
"Dislike, battery problem",1
"Has some software issue , screen touch response is slowed after miui 10 update , please xiaomi fixed it , overall a good product no doubt , camera is more good when gcam is used . Thanks Amazon for fast delivery .",4
"The one and only flagship grade smartphone that you can get at this price. I got this item for 13500 during the great Indian festival. You will definitely get the value for your money.
‚Ä¢ Use Gcam for maximum picture quality
‚Ä¢ Use pixel experience rom for clean software experience
[ NOTE: THERE ARE BETTER PRODUCTS THAN THIS IF BUDGET IS NOT A PROBLEM FOR YOU ]",5
"Good camera quality
 no lag pubg HDR mode
Very fast face lock
960fps slow motion video record
Total good performanceüëå",5
This brand is not focused one with the Company. Updates are very old and not upto the mark. Even Redmi Note 5 pro far advanced and fast in getting the updates.,2
"Amazing performance and battery life. Just a funny thing, it reads earphones print also along with fingerprints.",5
"its just awesome , don't look at 12mp+5mp , it is like 48mp camera , lightning performance , and it is now available at 16000 with other cashback offers , i purchase poco f1 on 4 oct in amazone sale , its totally budget phone with very powerful performance, i m happy with it.
FOR ANY QUESTIONS PLS ASK ME WITHOUT HESITATE",5
"Cracked and chipped from fall of only about 60 cm after 2 months! Furthermore the Xiaomi ""customer service"" team wasted hours of my time and refused to offer a free replacement. The local Mi Service Center ignores most calls and messages and finally quoted me more than 7,000 rupees for the replacement screen!",1
Product is good. Fast face unlocking sensor with good camera. Worth Buying With This Rate.,4
"Bad quality.
Cheap parts used.
Charger also of poor quality.
No ear phones",1
"Awesome mobile.
Value for money product for gamers.
Liquid cooling, limit the system heating.
Snapdragon soc 854 on budget.
Decent camera, use other app for camera.
No issue on screen, as reported by other reviewer.
Fast response.
MIUI11 update.",4
"Just switched from iPhone to Android to the PocoF1 series. Using it since 1 week, looks good and feels great. Is fast, battery life is great and charges full in under 2 hours. The camera is excellent. Love the Poco..",5
After using 5 days i feel that poco f1 is the best flagship phone with lowest price and having unlimited new features.battery life & camera quality  superb. I like mostly the face unlock system which is unbelievable.slow motion video...and small small issues also there in this phone which can be overcome after software update,5
"The charger started having loose contact problem within 2 weeks!  The screen freezes every now and then for a few seconds. Also, the corner area of the screen is not responding if you have any keys there. Would never recommend.",1
nice product.....value for money but no difference for 6gb and 8 gb ram speed....so better go for 6 gb ram..,5
Touch is not working properly 2 technician visit also done by Amazon still the issue didn't stopped and they put it for replacement but till date no replacement have been received it have been more than 10-15 days and I bought it on EMI and my whole credit card limit hav been held by them .... I didn't got a replace for this phone neither i got my money,1
Yes iam honestly reviewing after 1week of use this is best phn in this range but poco has to implement some extra future's and build quality and ir face lock also gud but it also unlocking even when we are closing our eyes and the main thing that this is a 845 processer in this price range this is the beast phone hope so this is helpful for u Thank u!!!,3
"Value for money
Good processor as well as camera also",5
"Great experience with poco f1. Lot to explore. But i am not happy with miui 10. lot of features missing compared to my earlier os emui 9. Custom reply not drive me to message app. Like that few features are missing. Apart from performance nad batter life are very good.
 Happy with the purchase.
Thanks amazon for timely delivery",4
"use google camera which is far better then default camera. face readaing is awsome, can detect face in midnight with out any light.

this phone is for performance, so its very good for performance. you can use this phone as computer. you can do almost many things.",5
"Very nice phone , works fast and feels snappy every thing is good just the battery life seems to be a weak point ,don't update your phone use it with miui 9.6 stock version it works fabulous ... Bank for your buck",5

"Great phone for my next two years.My comments are after 2 months of usage.Butter smooth experience!Really love the way processor is responding.Why wasting money on phones having 48,64 MP cam phones which literally uses 12 MP sensor?",5
"Dude buying this phone is totally a no Brainer man, nobody literally nobody is gonna give such an awesome phone for such a terrific price. I was scared at first of all the quality control issues I had heard of but as of now I have no issues at all its been like 2 months. I feel like I'm using a premium flagship and not a 15k phone!",5
"When i was ordered this item i have some worries about the phone
Is the phone have any screen bleeding issue
I heared aome phone has battery issues
When the phone delivery first  i check the screen, camera then battery perfomance
Perfect perfect camera  and system perfomance",5
Phone is great specially the gaming performance and game booster u can see the live fps count on the sceen which is very use full for gamers many people says that poco f1 is not worthy buying in 2020 but when u will use it by own it feels like it is released yesterday there is only one problem the charging speed is very low other wise it is great,5
"What an amazing phone. Still a beast in 2020, if you want this for pubg just go with your eyes closed. But do check out for bad quality product sometimes, you can replace it though. The device i got doesn't have battery drain issue nor ghost touch issue. It is awesome, even uptil iphone 7 they don't support HDR graphics in PUBG but POCO F1 does.",4
Poco F1 is still good deal in 2020 i purchase this but in this variant i face touch issue like so sensitive touch than work with wire and other things after all everything is best i like this phone more than realme xt it's better in everything than realme xt i compare personally,4
"Great.!  After update antutu score is amazing. Can play pubg on HDR ultra smoothly.
SD 845 is much better than G 90t. G 90t heats a lot  while heavy gaming that's why poco f1 is a good option than redmi note 8 pro.",5
"This product have touch problem, its kind of multi touch when I try to touch on something else, some other thing pops up. I was not sure then I try typing and I found the error, I cannot type ""a"" when I do it takes ""l"". Even if you try typing I take ""space"" between the letter. I would like to return it. And as well as refund me.",1
"Charging speed is slow although it contains fast charger......in comparison with one plus and moto....it takes 1 hour 45 min something
But battery backup is good....
Camera is above average......
Snapdragon 845 so fast......
And screen is bright and good quality......

Everything else is awesome...",4
"This is a winner handset even in 2020 also. The phone screen size is perfect in the world of tab sized handsets. Phone runs smoothly in heavy work scenario as well. Battery life for a day will satisfy you. Only concern is POCO is lacking in android updates it still runs on Android 9 , whereas Android 11 is right at the corner.",5
"When I have playing pubg without any lag and game play so smooth running. 4 to 5 hour best Battery backup phone.

 Best thing i have saw  night mode  face unlock I am so surprised I love it night time unlocked mode I am so happy.

Best Selfe Camera phone.

This is the one of the best smartphone under 15k budget.",5
processor is good . But Mi software is worst ever. And display response while playing games is poor. When Ever phone heats tha game starts to lag. Better try other brands with Snapdragon processor for good experience.,3
"I have purchased my mobile as on Oct 8, 2019.The present condition of my camera is not stable and I can observe lines while taking a pic and video.I have already updated the OS but the problem still persists.please resolve the issue.

"I got POCO F1(6-64) at Rs.15999, in this price you get previous year flagship processor, great camera, ad free miui experience, stereo speakers, infrared face id(works almost 98% accurate, flawlessly works in dark), what do you want more? It's run pubg in hdr high frame rate ‚ù§Ô∏èand lag free. Totally worth of money",4
"After 1 month of usage battery without gaming last for 20 hrs with music, movie, browsing, social media etc with gaming last for gaming it last for 8 to 9 matches of full time Pubg. Charging time is more. This is after 2 months of usage battery is still excellent. Hangs sometimes just for 1 second, that is not problem at all",4

"Not satisfied with performance..my mobile got strucked at least once or twice in a day while play pubg.very slow Charing .touch is not working properly at corners .I replaced mobile,again I have faced the same and then I returned.that to 8 gb ram also if working like this..it is very worrest.",1
Best Phone I have ever seen. It's a good product from Xiaomi,3
Bought for rs 18999. I'm in love with the performance of the phone. There's no phone with Snapdragon 845 in this price segment. The carbon fibre of armoured edition is soo good. The phone looks cool.,5
"See it's still a legendary device and always will be. Ultra smooth everything. Just but it and have fun and for another help
""DON'T USE THE GUESTURES"" AND FINGERPRINT SCANNER""

""USE FACE ID AND NAVIGATION BUTTONS"" TO SAVE A GOOD AMOUNT OF BATTERY""
the device is amazing.",5
"Amazing performance.
If your budget is low and still want flagship performance then go for it.
I got 6gb ram 128gb internal storage unit for 13400/- only
Shop using sbi card u will get 1600 discount instant and 1000 after order dispatched in amazon pay balance.",5
"Awesome mobile i got it from amazon @18999 8gb ram and 256 gb variant, battery life and finger print sensor works great and camera works fine and internet speed in this mobile is superb thanks to amazon such a valuable product and thanks XIAOMI",5
This is totally awesome deal! Exchanged my Note 5 Pro and got in this within 8-8.5k/- ! Was worried for its look...but its not actually that bad as i thought... instead it feels and looks good....goona try skins too if i get boredüòç,5
"Overall good configuration within budget, this product is highly recommendable.
Bit lack in ui interface as per my view(negligible), but after MIUI upgrade it is good enough.",4
with exchange and offer got this phone on 12500 rupees. and i guess its the only phone having SD 845 under 15000.,4
"For the price its at I really did not expect to get something this good. Extremely quick at completing tasks and it has a decent camera. Battery life is kickass, fast charging is on point. I am totally in love with this piece of tech. Thanks Xiaomi!!!",5
Excellent value for money with snapdragon845 good performance good camera and battery back up I bought this phone for gaming value for money üëç,4
The best budget mobile for low light photography...inbuild effefts are too good and G cam compatible... Highly recommended.  I have a Samsung Quard cam...but it dont hv shutter speed controlling ability...so bought this just for low light stuffs..and effects are amazing...,5
The picture clarity is good if I increase the brightness to 100% only if it is 50% brightness I am getting dark shades in photos. The battery is good and it is lasting for two days only at 50% brightness or else at 100% brightness for one and half days only. overall the POCO F1 is perfect for me.,5
Nice phone with flagship features. But lags in performance a little compared to actual flagship phones. Fingerprint reader is fast. Camera performance is awesome with gcam support. Battery life is decent. Some times very rarely having touchscreen unresponsive issues. Speed is good. Can play PUBG without lags.,5
"Sound Output is Just Average tough it has dual speakers, Stock Camera is Okeyish didnt try the GCAM
UI is smooth.
For day to day activites more than enough. But if you are looking for Camera, please excuse yourself from buying this mobile.",3
Delivery was on the date and I'm love with my device. I aslo brought Ringke Back cover ; the red one and it's so perfect now.,5
best phone ever. never hangs. very good camera. look wise also good. 845 sd in such a low price. its got game turbo mode. it is very fast. i dropped it 2 times on the floor by mistake  and not a single scratch.,5
"Poco is a beast when it comes to fps gamings.
But buying this phone in 2020 is not a great idea. Still hats off to Xiaomi, literally a budget flagship killer!",4
Major touch issue. Ghost touch. Not recommended at all. Product is old model from 2018. Has major multitouch issues !,1
The phone doesn't look so premium but works like one. It gives a smooth gaming performance without significant heating. I loved the face detection process at dark. I have actually got no issues with the phone till now after using it for nearly four months.,5
All are busy looking note 8 pro...But this one is beast.Only looks and the display size is gud is note 8 pro ..comparing to this..camera is almost decent .not having wide angle photo and .so on..but if u put gcam the camera quality is more than enough..no adds and SD845 is better than G90T ...GO FOR POCO,5
Message service does not support...after update it start working...but in second update it fail in multi go,3
Screen bleeding issue,5
"Don't by this phone now. Battery draining problem is a big issue now after the latest update. Before this it was a real flagship phone . And you can also face some lagging now just because of that update. Really disappointed on xiaomi for this.
Better choose a phone launched recently",4
"It has snapdragon 845 but while I was playing call of duty it had continuous lags, screen drops, hanging issues, very bad experience as per performance although camera was pretty awesome. Good battery. I don't recommend buying this now because I faced same issue after replacement aswell.",2
"Even without prime membership, delivery was lightning quick.
Although the unit is manufactured in 2018, doesn't habe any screen bleeding issue or ghost touch.

Working fine.",4
Nothing to be disliked at this price,5
VOIP calls were getting mute very frequently. The other party was not able to hear what I am speaking. Went to service center but they couldn't fix as they were claiming it is not hardware issue. I was disappointed with their response because VOIP calls are frequently used now a days.,2
As expected its a beast . Being a 3rd phone in my family its worth it always & now at 16k for 8/256 armoured edition its icing on the cake . Very recommended.,5
Superb performance of sd845. Giving rating from this phone only. Got a steal deal from Amazon. Best phone under 20k.,5
"Everything is good, but still, there are some heating issues.....

Although you can go for this if 15k is your budget, it's totally good then.",4
Faulty product recieved !! Back panel swollen. Now getting replacement from Amazon is a pain in the ***. Worst service from Amazon. Although 5 Stars for the product !! 0 stars for Amazon.,1
"Good combination of power from mi phone,

Great Camera, Battery and fast processor.
Believe me its Awesome.",5
"The poco f1 is just more than what I expected as it is. Its a great performance oriented smart phone with an overall perfection in each of its aspects. The fingerprint scanner,face unlock and the liquid cooling technology do well contributions in order to make this phone a  grand success.",5
"Best mobile in this price, good for gaming, no heating issue, no lagging just play games smoothly, camera is also best",5
"No Amazon prime HD support
But update also give but not working Amazon prime hd",5
"I got this product today ( 05.03.2020)

There is no zero star review option.

Really good product. Has great battery life and performance as well.,5
"I bought this device for 17k during the great Indian festival.
The only problem u will face will be that it does not have an amoled screen.

The back of this phone is so much cooler and long lasting being an armored edition with kevlar back.",5
Good. But in all MI expected IR blaster. It is not having. Battery is draining out bit faster comparing Mi 7 Pro,4
"I installed two WhatsApp (dual app).  The problem is that when I receive any image and download it, after some time it says ""media is not available on this device""

Then I have to switch off and on the mobile. Then again, I am able to see the image.",3
"VERY HEAT Generator
GHOST CONTACTS IN SECOND SPACE WHICH DISAPPER AND APPEAR AUTOMATICALLY

For Rs.15,500 there's nothing to complaint and ask for.",5
"Very speed face unlock, speed charging, speed operations.
I bought this for 14399 rupees on 10% instant bank discount.

Worth every Paisa.
If you want good performance mobile blindly go with this.",5
This phone is defective - doesn't gets switch on as well as doesn't get charged. Asked Amazon for replacements. Amazon scheduling inspection before taking back. but there service providers are not showing up and Amazon  delaying replacements intentionally. This is worst experience.,1
"Perfect phone in terms of performance.
All features are up to the mark. I loved it.

Note- Device body is a bit thick than normal phone, I want to mention this because some people prefer slim and sleak design, so take care of that.",4
"I don't need to tell anything about it it's outstanding .
But the case provided is little loose .
Dust will go inside the case very easily and makes scratch on my beautiful rosso red back
That's the only problem I face
Totally satisfied",5
The product is very bad and it is heating up when using internet and not worth of 15999,1
Best purchase..working nicely..no problem with battery or screen as complaint by some users..bought at 19000 armoured edition.face unlock is amazingly fast even in the darkness.only issue i can see with the phone is that when you zoom in the camera the pixels of it gets teared.,5
This phone has aged well in the sea of smartphones at this price category. Running official MIUI 11 on Android 10.,5
Best phone if performance and gaming is priority with add on superfast face unlock,5
Awesome features especially snap dragon flagship processor 845 for a less price. Thanks to Amazon for providing a  super fast delivery in 30 min. I strongly recommend you to buy the product through Amazon as they deliver a original fresh product at lightening speed.,5
"This is my 8GB 256GB poco
Worst phone, over heating, touch issue, less performance, too much rendering while playing games (pubg). For normal use it's good but for gaming(pubg) it is very bad especially for pro players. I brought this only for gaming but it's not worth it",1
"Its realy cheap for 13500. Really beats the shit out of the competition with the snapdragon 845, the best choice for heavy users, battery is just sufficient,no heating issues, notch is personal choice and doesnt bother me",4
"Poco F1 is equal to One Plus 6.
But price was very less
Excellent job by poco f1",4
I think i got a defective product. I'm facing a lot of touch issues. I don't know it's a common issue or not. Anyway very bad experience when it comes to Amazon support,3

Good value for mony

Quick finger print reading",5
Bad product. Within a month of purchase (Oct'19) the swipe function does not work. Wanted to switch off the mobile but that also does not work. Wonder how to raise a complain or get a refund. Amazon is selling such sub standard product ! Abhijit Roy,1
Mobile is good. Xiaomi should give option to customers for Xiaomi apps. I don‚Äôt really like the apps from Xiaomi by forced to c see them regularly in my mobile,5
Performance all are good but only one thing when I charge this phone with company Adapter I observed a bit of current pass on camera lens. It so scary to me.,5
Battery life  and all are okay but it has a bit insesnsitive touch plus kinda unreliable appearance . Also it has very troublesome notifucation bar which doesnt work properly. For its discounted price it can do but at usual price u better opt something better.,3
Best performance,5

Wonderful,5
Good phone  but miui 11 update does not bring android 10. So little disappointment with update it may also be possible that it stays with android 9. Performance is fine. It records good slow motion videos upto 240fps but at 960fps it records only for 1 sec.,4
The finger print is not being recogonized and the phone has been heating up so fastly within minutes( added the fact that i was away from home and hence used the phone for the first time today). I deeply regret the choice of buying this product from Amazon,1
Awesome performance but last two days its screen hang after call disconnected occasionally. I received on 15th august.,4
I have yet to find a fault in this. The only improvement area could be the weight. But not an issue with current weight. üíêüíêüíê,5

Battery life is good(fast charger 18W great)",5

Otherwise, it is all good.",4

This one goes beyond imagination. Poco F1 stands alone as Best class in good budget.,5
"It's still good in 2020 just because of processor Snapdragon 450. Camera, fingerprint and all other things are good.",5
"Great battery life & performance. This phone does not get bogged down by the high number of apps intlled. The camera quality is excellent, though the zoom quality is below average. Overall it is totally worth the price.",4
"Touch issue.....camera is not great....
But Internet speed is very good and fast.",1
"Perfect choice .. I m fully satisfied with poco f1 performance.
Better than #Oneplus6t, realmeX, vivo zx, redmi8pro,honorplay,",5

Battery life is very poor.. what is a use of having flagship mobile with poor battery..,3
"Compact, highly features, clear snaps, battery life though good but scope to improvised, value for money product in its segment. Well recommended.",5
A fantastic smartphone at this price range. Can compete with flagships like Oneplus 5t. The notch is pretty big and the corners seems to be cut more but overall it's a great phone with a powerful processor.,5

Camera quality, mainly the 4K 60fps video is a lot good.
Batter charging speed is quite low, that for battery life..
Gaming experience is good...overall.!",5

Poco is good mobile phone and very much sitisfied with battery life and camera. Only expectation which was not met was either 2and SIM can be inserted or extra memory card and not both.,5

"Just go for it guys, just go don't think it's a great phone with great specs . I bought in Great Indian festival sale and i got amazing deal. Don't listen anyone it's a better choice .",5
When I bought touch seems laggy but aftr a update(still in android8) it is mucher faster in touch and performance too.. I am happy with the poco f1. Good awesome phone in this price nothing can challenge in performance wise.,4
Got this mobile for 13.4k(with 16k price having 1k as Amazon pay balance and 10% discount for pre-payment) and this is a very good bang for buck at that price range. Nothing to say more than that as all knows what sd845 is.,5
"Just awesome, but screen touch functionality is not that good, may be it's due to software.. super fast, smooth, not lagging. Cooling is good,",5
"Fingerprint not needed ,....its been 6 month I have been using only face unlock ...and I m pretty sure it can easily challenge apple's face ID",5
Still the best. Bought it secomd time. Earlier one screen got shattered due to fall. Had 128/6 gb now got 256/8 gb. Must have protective cover.,5
I got a phone with so many issues restarting and hanging.after one month I have not received mobile replace or repair.still mobile is with service centre so I strongly not recommended this mobile.,1
Nothing to dislike - thing's a beast - gaming to camera to display(no screen bleeding in mine?) to features - this phone is unbeatable - you ain't getting snapdragon 845 and such camera performance at15k in any other phone,5
On a budget it rocks!! But there are still some software issues.,5

"I think this is the best mobile under 16k and better than redminote 8 pro and other camera quality best and don't forget snapdragon 845, only thing you have to do is use your poco carefully dont drop it otherwise it best.",5
"emi not converted which offer was emi interest free
Why cheat me ?
I have balance for payment

Network performance is awesome but camera quality is not good as expected ( compared to Redmi note 6 pro ) : Battery life is also not good : finger print and screen quality is very good : Overall 3 star quality,3
Performance top notch I buy this in October 19 and used couples of month I am confused between k20 or poco F1 but for me performance itls matter so I wnet with the poco performance beast in upper budget segment,5

But after performence score all of this device
Finally poco fill all requirement except design
In mid range device",5

The gaming experience is so good ..
The main thing in this phone the IR face unlock..it unlocks phone in no light places also...",5
Under budget its good one. Those who looking for internal storage and battery backup can go for it. But for camera lovers can go for upgraded one.,4
"This is my second poco F1 in 6 months. Bought this one on a sale, great value for money. Great camera, very good battery life, stays cool after long duration use too.",5
Overall the phone is amazing. The only missing thing is battery life... It ends in half day if you use the phone continuously... I think a 4000 Mah battery lasts for one full day after continuous use. I liked the phone,5
"Battery life 10 hours,speaker complaint,voice not clarity",1
With this price you cannot complaint about anything.,5
"everything is okay.. but i didn't get that why that phone box didn't wraped by plastic, usually it does... and i saw 2 seals on both side one is taken off easily and i saw a chinese logo.. i don't get that.",5

"Rear camera is not so good, pin for head is also above rt side ,which touches the screen n disturb. It should be at bottom as usual .
Split screen option is not there.
Rest is avarage.",4
"¬†Camera , processor, battery, are awesome
But tuch issues problem some time while playing video on YouTube in my case.
Good for gaming and camera user.",4
For a 256 GB memory phone with 8 GB ram the battery life should have been a little more like 4.5 or 5 Mha....,5
"Phone is outdated but it can out perform any phone till date with its beastly performance in this price range.
No one is near to its performance  in its price range.
It made me its fan..I love my poco f1",5
"Camera quality is up to the mark
Battery drains faster when you use continuously for 5-6 hours .... Like from 98% to 30%
Face lock is superb
Dual camera set up is good ...but would have been better.",4
Nice product,5
Nice product,5

"Quick delivery,genuine product, device is very smooth ,no lag . üòç camera has clarity and it has video stabilisation",5
I am feeling amazing after using it... Everything looks excellent and the its cooling technology is simply amazing .... I used it for last 4h hours and didn't feel heat ...Go for it .... No tension...,5
"Well the product is good no doubt but expected it to be far better, the scroll down in apps like FB is not fast enough even the typing speeds are also not upto the mark...",3
Value for money very Good Phone with excellent discount.,4
Received defective product. Bleeding issue and also received one year old product. But returned and received good product. Now happy with mobile. Camera image processing is ultimate. Loved the speed.,4
1 star less for that screen bleading issue...,4
This is one of the best products by xiaomi. Added with excellent delivery by amazon. The phone is fast. Battery is powerful. The face unlock is super fast. All in all a great phone. Must buy,5
"This is legit product of poco f1, I was skeptical first but the phone is a flagship killer. Impressive, I would buy poco f2 if it is available.
I've been using it now for a week and is smooth working perfectly.",5
Fall in love this mobile,5
"Suiting to needs to maximum, cutting very less on pocket due to the advantages of this PocoF1 smart phone",5

"It has great hardware for the price. Camera is average though. Gcam is recommended. The software experience was great, but the latest update had throttled performance, so rather disappointed with the company.",3
"Best gaming phone.
Image quality is low,
Best price

"Snapdragon 845 within 15,000......pubg lovers go for it........no real me 5 pro,no mi k20,no oppo or no vivo........poco still rules the gaming era that too in budget",5
"Not poco f1 first,.
  2nd poco f1....
Very slow processor, and battery life fast drain.....
This price15999‚Çπ

.",4
"Even after connecting to a wifi connection, the phone disconnects from it in less than a minute.... How's that even possible? Above this when it connects again, it's working damn slow (like an 2G/3G network)",1
The best phone among phones in this class.,5
The best performance mobile at the price segment but every pocof1 is having touch issues and multi touch problem and nothing more great phone with the best it face unlock which any other phone has,3
Speed is good enough..no lagging..user interface quite good..fingerprint reader best camera quality enough. Battery life... good good..,4
"Camera is really pathetic... Battery drain so fast if you play games like PUBG, Cyber Hunter....
And every Big issue of all is this phone is having liquid cooling system still so much heating issues...",3
Battery life is good...efficiently working but camera quality of this phone is not bad but actually worse... When you zoom images get blurred...  Only selfie lovers like this but pls don't look for clarity.,4
Good product. Camera should've been better at this price point.. Needs improvement.. otherwise mobile is perfect for day to day use....,5
Expected more,1
"Poco f1.... Compared with the price point, the features offered by the phone is good. The only con for me is that the phone is heavy.
Continuous usage and my hand starts to pain. Otherwise its good enough.",4
High performance smartphone. Amazing!,5
I know 4 people that own poco f1 and none of them are dissapointed with the performance of this phone. This phone is the true definition of 'value for money'.,5
Just no words for performance,5
"I like finger print reader very fast reaction, Battery life is average, back camera is very good quality",4
I like everything but my personal favourite is ir face unlock sensor work super in night without any artificial light and it's camera and performence is real flagship,5

Within my budget",4

had to ask for a replacement unit as the phone came with a cracked/scratched screen and the replacement unit came on march 9 and its only about 1 month and my charging cable is already not working anymore,2
This is the perfect phone even after almost an year. Better than Real me X. You get the best specs @best price.,5
"Got this for only 13400rs
For the 6gb ram /128gb storage varient
Auur kya chahiye üòÇ",5
Amazing gameplay experience in pubg,5

Sim holding tray quality very poor with compare price and other feature need lits if improvement it hardly cost 10 to 15 rs to nanufactrer,3

Unable to uninstall MI Browser. There is lot of disturbance in MI browser.,5
Theke best.,5
"Received a damaged piece with a small crack and minute scratches all over the screen.

The only drawback is that being the flagship product of Xiaomi it doesn't give you the premium feel. (Back panel of the phone) rest assured that the product is awesome..,4

Its a performance beast for a small price but the mi heavily customised UI is very snappy and not performant. Sometimes with such a beast configuration there are lags,4

"This is the best phone i have used. Great camera, Amazing battery that last me for 9 hours easily even after playing games on it plus it has type c charging so the phone will be charged by 2 hours. It does not over heat while playing games as it has liquid cooling. Super quick phone easy to use. Best thing is that i can easily compare it to the 1 plus 6. Some features might even be better. I have used it for around two months and i don't think i will ever need to change my phone for a long time.",5
"just trust me and buy the amazing phone
best in class
best phone for budget with snapdragon 845
available only in red rosso",5
"I bought a Poco F1 (6GB/128GB) last week from a nearby shop. I was looking for a device for excellent processing under 20K with a Snapdragon SoC and 6GB RAM with 128 GB Memory. So, I have found the F1 is the best for me. I have seen many reviews on youtube and after 1 year it is still a better choice than other newer devices.

anyway here is my review.

Pros:

1. Build quality- it feels light but premium. It can easily use a single hand. Feels lighter than similar-sized devices. The buttons are on the right side and easily can be accessed with the right-hand thumb or left direction fingers. Same with the fingerprint sensor. The device comes with most of the usable sensors. my score 9/10.

2. Display- the display is good and produces the colors with accuracy. I am using another J7 Prime 2 which has a TFT IPS display and also used A5 (2017),A50/A70 which has an AMOLED display which makes the color over-saturated. So, I will put the F1 display in between them. The brightness is also enough to use it in direct sunlight and in total darkness. Only thing I found con is the long notch. So, my score 9/10.

3. Battery life- it comes with a 40 MaH battery with fast charging. With Jio/Airtel two 4G sims, it lasts easily one day with normal usage. And the charging is very fast. it took about 2 hours max to full charge the battery depending upon how much battery power you have left. score 10/10.

4. Audio quality- it comes with a mono speaker that sounds quite loud. The speaker for calling also has good enough sound. you can take a call anywhere. And also enjoy your music/video with ease. score 10/10.

5. Call/data/wifi quality- I am using it to make calls. The network reception is very strong. Both SIMs work on 4G VoLTE at the same time. Mobile data and wifi are also strong and stable. No issue is there. 10/10 from me.

6. Camera- Both the front selfie camera and the back camera is very good. Both produce good acceptable results. I have not used them much, but still able to take some selfies and shots on Diwali night. You can see them with this review. 9/10.

7. U.I./OS- U.I. is very amazing. The device comes with ""Poco Launcher"" which can be downloaded from Google play store. It is simple, smooth, customizable and supports tons of themes. The device comes with very little bloatware, no annoying Microsoft apps and most of the Mi apps can be removed easily. So, you can easily load it up with your most used and favorite apps only. Personally I love the gesture features and because of it, you don't have to go to the bottom and press the buttons. I already got the latest O.S. Upgrades/updates which have made the device smoother. I have not encountered any annoying ads till yet. 10/10

8. Security- the device comes with the usual security such as PIN, Password, and pattern along with fast fingerprint and face unlock features. The fingerprint is very fast and accurate. As for the face unlock, it is damn good. works fast and even in night darkness also. The device supports dual app support and app lock also. So, you can share it without any privacy issue. my score 10/10.

9. Performance- It is my most favorite part. The monstrous Snapdragon 845 nd Adreno 640 is very powerful. I have bought this device to stream and play ""Call of duty; Mobile"" game. The game starts with a very high max setting and looks amazingly detailed with shadows, blood splitting, explosive effect, building details, etc. I played the game up to character level 101 on my old J7 Prime and now it feels entirely different experience n the F1.  Same with Need For Speed: No Limit where everything looks stunning. last but not least the PUBG game starts with HD mode and looks like a proper PS/Xbox game. I played the very first game on Miramar map and won it for a very high-quality look. e,g I saw the last enemy hiding on a bush and shoot on him on the head with a single shot. Last but not least the device dnt heat up much and consumes heavy battery (rops abut 10% o 15% in 2 hours depending upon the game and game settings) . Again this is very specific to the individual user depending on his/her game types, game settings, apps installed, etc. my score 10/10.

10. Game launcher- It is a single app where you can manage and play your games in one place. This apps enables ""Do not disturb"", ""Shutts off auto brightness"", ""Scree shot"", ""share to facebook"", ""screenshot"",""screen recorder"" etc by single tap.  10/10 from me.

Cons-

Personally I don't see any major cons on the device. at the price, you don't complain much. But I will still mention some shortcomings.

1. No NFC and IR blaster, if you need them, then this is not for you.

2. I wish there is another speaker set grill on the left side to make it the proper speaker perfect device.

3. the headphone jack is located in a weird location. I mean if you use a wired headphone to play games, the headphone jack feels a little awkward near the left thumb. But if you use a Bluetooth one, then this is ok.

So, this is my review and experience abut the Poco F1. I read what I felt and saw, nothing less or more.

If you like my review useful, then please give an upvote, so that other can also read it. Regards and thanks in advance.",5
"Guys this phone is awesome but some people say it's fake due to the logo 'pocophone ' and as u can see in the next pic this phone is from Europe,Singapore and USA so no need to panic it's called as pocophone in those countries and in India the launch name is poco so you'll get it with the name poco and as u can see it's from poco",5
"6 months after
Battery, performance, fingerprint scanner, face unclock 5+/5
Camera wity gcam 4/5
No heating issue nothing as such
Only style is 3/5
Reat all great phone",5
"Bought it from a wholesaler. Its an okay phone. Speed is very good. Sleek and stylish. Quite heavy. The only problems i have is that the phone heats up a lot when playing pubg, tethering or on long whatsapp calls. Second, the battery backup is not very good lasts for 8 hours max. Also the body is polycarbonate and the screen is very fragile and breaks easily.",2
Stupid product. Apps are delayed and have to restart several times. How to dispose this .I do t mind throwing this. Thought this will help with more ram.sucked,1
I bought the 6 gb ram 128 gb storage variant at 15k and i couldn't believe I'm getting snapdragon 845 chip in this! Other devices at this price have 6 series processors with some fancy waterdrop notch or 4 5 cameras. But for me the chip really matters and this device was a no brainer! Also cameras are really good. Came close to winning the blind camera test right?!,5
"Are you a hard core Gamer? Wanna be a pro at PUBG MOBILE ? Worried about high price? Want a cheap Mobile with all the specs installed? Why are you waiting? Go buy this right now‚ô•Ô∏è

Honestly SD 845 processor makes a huge difference within 20k price range. There is no smell of Lag issue. Smooth like a Hot knife on butter. If you're a hard core Gamer then this is the best choice to buy. ( Opt for 8GB variant )

Second thing is System UI performance . Basically each & every Xiaomi device get regular stable updates , so there will be a bug free environment üëç

Camera! Ahh... Neither a pro Nor a regular one. Mainly developers focused more on device performance so you can't point out on why camera is not so good as other device. Obviously they cannot provide good camera within this range. So ladies üòÅ if you're looking for a selfie device then opt for any other.

Battery ü•∫ 4000mah! Pretty decent. You can play upto 4 PUBG Erangle game charge dropping from 100% to somewhere near 15%. Each match estimated to last long 45min. So far Battery is good.

Now you may ask what about CPU Temperature ü§î ! Well it's not that hot. While extreme gaming it reaches upto 39¬∞. Overall it can be rated between 85-90/100 .

Finally! It's a value for product ü§ë I'm writing this review with Poco itself üòã Go! Buy it right now",5
"First of all Amazon delivery made me unhappy.
Coming to phone,
Pros: camera quality is awesome
For games it's ok I love to play asphalt 9 very much clear and fast no lags.
The battery can be useful for up to 9 hours if you're normal user 24 hours.
And the phone outlook and quality is fine.
Cons: sometimes it gets heat a lot while charging and playing pubg.
Too much lags in pubg but graphics levels are peaks.
And few options are not user-friendly.
Price is a little high
Overall happy to use especially loved the camera",3
"So after a month uses, I am writing this review. Battery, heating and bit camera should be upgraded. Rest the phone performance, its beast. I am plaaying pubg, call of duty, brothers in arms and asphalt legends 9 but it nevere gave me a single reason for disappointment. User interface gives you premium feel. Every single things can be editable. So coming to the point, Battery is getting hot at the time of charging so i am charging it in switch off. Battery Backup should be bit more fine but still it works for a day after playing of pubg for an hour. Rest camera should be bit more advanced. But if all thse things will be ok then why it comes with a price tag of this so dont think just go for it. It has so many pros that all these managable cons will not be considerd. So if you are looking for a performance phone you can buy it in ur sleep.",5
This phone doesn't lagging even a high capacity game can be handled by this mobile v v short lag period,5
"This product is too costly
When compared to
Other products

Fingerprint working that only I can tell

Battery capacity is big but
It can be used around 6 to 7 hours
If u need more duration of battery life
Call log, music that all, just press lock button.

Value for money?
It has sd 845

Other than than

Completely wast of money",1
I think it's better to by 12k phone from Xiaomi rather than buying flagship it's worthless to invest 23-24k and experience is same like 12k phone.,3
This is a very capable smartphone but its battery life is very low. If you take any rupees 10000 plus smartphone with mid level to higher processor phone than you can see how bad it's battery life is. Xiaomi has lowered its battery time for its lower price. I have this phone in my family and I can see it is not a good buy for anyone. This is my free advice.,3
"This is the best smartphone under budget, it is directly fight with high budget smartphone such as: one plus 6, iPhone 7,6,6s etc.
It's hardware and software performance is gorgeous  , specially the camera performance mind-blowing I have no word to tell.",5
It is very goodphone and worth its money.battery life is excellent . Very fast down loading videos from YouTube.updates are regular.,5
"The back of the smart phone is not rugged as it seemed on pictures, 5000 mah battery backup will make it better. Dimple appeared at some place of screen while playing games like pubg etc. Photos taken at night by normal mode is better than those taken by night mode. Silicon back cover provided along with it is too soft , does not have good snug fit. Did find some lagging issue when played pubg for long hour.
Magnification while playing pubg causes disruption, when accidentally double tap occurs, screen pinning option is missing.

Finger print sensor is good, ir face recognition is also thumbs-up, camera is ****, reflex seamed better while playing pubg another üëç for the 845 processor. Speaker sound is ok for media playback.",3
"I would have given 5 stars if its display is perfect but its setting on the screen is pathetic... Its having great specs but display is also an important part of a mobile, so I cant give 5 out of 5. Touch is superb, dashing looks, awesome camera, very fast charging, great performance till date after using 3 months, so fast, no hang at the time of game like fifa, pubg.. Alllllllllll ok.. but think if u playing football and a portion is always blocked in filed, how it seems to be ..... if u can ignore that display issue then thi is the best deal in market.. just no doubt about it...",4
This one is least user friendly phone i have used so far. A few apps i have installed disappeared from the display screen for some reason. Very irritating.  Key pad gets activated when your on a call and the person on the other side often complained that they hear beeps as the number keys are keyed in due to the contact of the screen to the ears. I do not recommend this product.,2
"Camera is amazing. I have clicked many photos and they are top notch. also, the build is solid. I have dropped my phone so many times but thank god, there is only a screen crack, the touch still works. The battery lasts for 1.5 days if u use social media, however i have not tried gaming. The fingerprint and face detector are very quick. The processing speed is also very good. I bought 128Gb one so its been a year now and there is ample space. Anyone looking for a good camera and a good battery life, and sturdy build can go for it.",5
Screen is too much sensitive from the bezels eventhough I exchanged it (cause every model has this issue).It's a deal breaker for me cause while gaming even if I'm not touching the screen it senses my touch and touches anywhere and  little wet sweaty hands it's impossible to use it cause It keeps on touching everywhere like the device is hacked or something(impossible to type),3
Please avoid the product as amazon is bluffing its costumers by selling defective pieces which are manufactured last year .As my phone screen is showing unusual light in bottom left corner but then also amazon is refusing to replace the piece giving excuse that it is feature of the phone which is absolutely false .it one the manufacturing defect .,2
"Iam using the phone for past 4 months ,I bought this for playing pubg iam happy with that,zero lag it runs smoothly even in ultra HD mode ,game booster is there to reduce ping issue,call quality , battery life , display,face unlock in dark ,finger print, tooooooo guddd go for it if ur a gamer ,camera was 3/5 AVG, while playing continuously 2 hours it heats but not that much max.. built quality too gud ,I bought the best case for my rosa red colour ringke red colour go for it ,looks sexy in hand ....",5
"It came with good features, anyone can think it is a beast. I bought it offline. Here are my reviews:

Camera quality is awesome. But after 2 months of usage, camera didnot work, several error came. Google Poco F1 camera issue for more details. ALl issues with camera will start after 2-3 months for most users.

Screen has bleeding issue, touch insensitive. I think this is the worst phoneI purchased till date.
Don't buy ...",1
"Got the Forth Phone for the family. Almost evry switched to this phone for an unmatched dependability and performance it provides. Camera is real good in day light and indoors! Dark images, judge by yourself",5
I  purchased the phone on 30sep 19. I phone I recieved is outdated version. Even the picture shows that phone is of last year. Even the Android version mentioned in site was snapdragon 845 but I recieved some old Android version. After asking for return request also there is no reply from the team and now thr reutrn request is also blocked.,1
Plz improve battery life after six mothe use battery discharge ratio increase and price drop so fast I felt i' m chutiya.,3
"It is a good phone because it more speedy works
Poco f1 comes with a processor of snapdragon 855  it nice to playing online games such as pubg cod coc etc the phone come with back and front camera back of 12+5mp that is 5 mp focus and front camera by 20 mp i think both camera are so nice it have dual 4g sim slot it's is very helpful for jio users  and it have good look gorilla glass finger print reader for phone and app lock and face  recognition for lock screen and app lock it is good
It comes with a full screen display and good battery life  of 4000 mah and the delivery is good  good packing by mi and also by amazon this phone hang at the time of storage full and have a little size and weight this phone good for this money I m using this phone for 1. 5 year I have nt get any complaints thanks for mi and amazon I think this review is helpful for you",5
"Super
edit 9 feb
not wroth when compared to poco x2, i bought this for 15500 on republic sale. camera is awesome. latest updates we are getting, gcam mod available, but touch is not as good as my previous phone mi max 2, i didn't see any screen bleeding issues, i put hide big notch on settings. may be good for gaming lovers. other wise x2 is better main point is we get ir face recognize even in nights it detect my face. but no ir remote, which i need but compromised. go to x2 64 gb available same price as 256 gb is not necessary while all content is available online freely.",5
"I have this poco f1, phone is good but mi is not good at after sale service I got yellow spots on screen and went to service center and they changed display with a cheap display and technician made a mistake and my receiver not work now I have to repair it from local vendor I have made many complaint to MI support but they have no clue about my issue. Useless brand with useless staff",1
"Value for money product. Features are good. Battery life is OK and lasts for more than 12 hours. Fingerprint reader is working fine do far. Sometimes small delay us noticed.
Not happy with the camera of Poko. I had purchased A2 mobile a month earlier. The quality of the still photo as well as video are much better than Poko mobile.",4
"I have been using this for past 2 days, & the only thing I didn't liked for now is its finger print scanner placement, sometimes I accidentally put my finger on the camera, other than that haven't faced any hardware or software issues, will keep updating this comment for future updates",5
Worst product. Wastage of hard earned money.,1
"Worth for money. Nice processor and liquid cooled technology,speed IR face response,excellent gaming performance and no heat on ultra hd (in pubg).Call of duty also.No lagging or hanging on multitasking..Finally I got the cool and nice one.",5
"Very poor product. I purchased it yesterday only  and after starting the phone screen goes totally blank. Nothing comes on screen. Talked to amezon executive, but typical talking. I will not buy any item from Amazon here afterwards.",1
"Using Poco F1 Rosso Red for nearly 1 month....Nothing issue except LCD Display...But obe request to Xiaomi...pls, don't slow down the capabilities of SD845...Hear that they are slowing down with each update so that customer shifts to another phone... Don't do this...We need SD845 at full speed...",4
"This is the best budget smartphone in both camera and performance you can buy. Snapdragon 845 is smooth as hell and the camera is just wowwww, you can click whatever you imagine with this smartphone. POCO F1 will always be my one of the most loved smartphone. I have been using this smartphone from almost a year and trust it has never disappointed me. From the fingerprint reader to almost everything is best at this budget. Just one thing i felt its lacking is Gorilla Glass for more safety.",4
"While playing pung it heats, camera is good but in green pics it is not focused and sharp in Marco  or near shorts. I am also facing issue with touch it is very sensitive and weirdly responsive.
Amazon says u will not get the refund it will only be replaced. Bad service by them. Disappointing.",3
"This phone was launched an year ago but specs of this beast still beat many phone in same price range, go for it while it's available, its a great phone, hope mi introduce its successor soon.",5
"This is an awesome product, this poco is for gaming but if you are thinking to install social apps it may lower your performance.phone is a deadly combination of snapdragon and liquid cooling.
if you are thinking to buy a in budget gaming phone , i will recommend POCO.

ITS ON HOW YOU USE THE PHONE.",4
"This is the worst mobile I had used
Hanging eventhough free memory space
Unable to attend the call occasionally hanging during calls
Network issues in this mobile no internet speed in this mobile in any network in city area also some lag in network",1
"Touch screen sensibility is not so satisfactory.
Sometimes recognizes the finger print after 2 - 3 attempts.
Battery life OK to some extent.",4
"Best mobile in this price segment at this time
Processor is quite good ( good for gaming)
And camera is average
And face unlock is super fast",4
This is a seriously genuine review after using it 7 month..this phone processor started working malfunctions..i bought it for pubg gaming..but you can't record the screen while playing the game smoothly..tuch to process response is not so good..and I don't know the bullet registration is so far good of any iPhone,3
"This phone is heaven for speed lovers, great graphics, superb camera, and it comes with android one. Go for it. Best under 30k phone. You know other brands have launched similar phones for 25k, 27k, 29k. This one beats them by a couple of miles.",5
I cancle this product of dealy of delivery i brought from mi shop. It is good for use no lag prblem compare to one plus 6t series this is good for middle class money,5
I always wanted one plus 6 (not T) but the issue was price. My friend have one plus 6 he suggested Poco f1. And I don't regret I purchased this phone. Awesome camera with shutter speed control n super slomo. Processor is fast. Many people still haven't heard about this phone til now.,5
"All good I'm using this phone from 2 months and it a beast. But please mind the screenshot :p

Phone 6GB & 8GB variant only",5
"This phone is very good, camera quality is fulfilled ur need, also very fast in processing.Only thing u have to take care is don't use ur mobile while charging it, it will get battery swelling.",5
"Best phone I ever had. üòçüòçüòçüòçüòç
Using this phone for almost an year now. Super solid stable phone. It had all those premium hardware except OLED screen and metallic body but was sold then at around 20k.

Even now this is a beat buy phone ant reduced pri√ße tag.",5
Bal,1
"Got this phone at 17.2k, which is a steal considering the amazing specs this phone has..
Amazingly smooth, decent camera",5
"phone is not working properly and also the customer service was not responding .....

"Super phone
Never hang
High internet speed
Good camera
High speed fingerprints and ir face scaner",5
Good,4
"Using this phone more than one year, you cannot get a phone worth more than this in the same price range, battey is great,camera is good,  face unlock is awesome, totally this phone is a pro. There is no use of launching Poco F2 yet.",5
Very bad service. I update the latest version of MIUI11 and after that my phone getting hanged. The service is not good. They said that why you update that version. I truly said that please don't purchase this. I am very disappointed by the POCO service.,2
"I have been using this phone as my daily driver since the day I received it and I have to day this is the best phone within ‚Çπ20000. Price to performance ratio is amazing.
Its worth more than its price, go for it.",5
Pubg players don't buy it. Very poot multi touch sensitivity,2
¬†K20 PRO ...OTHERWISE THIS IS THE BEST OPTION AVAILABLE @REASONABLE PRICE!,5
"In simple words, Poco is just a beast and worth at this price range, about display its not like screen bleeding slightly a white shade coming outat the bottom, but its not that much issue, even I thought before buying this but I am happy now",4
"I was sceptic before ordering. smiled is overrated as this screen is more than you need. You do not need anything more. It is fast very fast. Very good screen.  Lot of storage and fun phone.

2 pc screen bleed not much.",5
It is the best phone i ever had this the phone which i wanted . I can play pubg in HD+ with out any lag and no heat up until 1 hour great phone in less price,5
Great phone with great features. Best processor and great memory.  Touch screen is a tad slow. But is a good buy for the price..,5
"Every thing looks good , great performance ,great battery, captivating camera but the most worst thing is display. After using it for 9 months now iam facing issues with screen, a yellow colour mark is appeared on the screen .",4
One of the best flagship mobile product with less money,5
Bought it for PUBG as it was the no. 01 flagship of Xiaomi at the time when it was released. In conclusion not good to play games like PUBG.,3
The phone heats up a bit and it charges fast for few months and it breaks up the speed gradually. Processor is good no complaints regarding the performance . Good camera üòò . In 2019 this phone is not a better choice,5
"Flagship quality specs for a mid-range price.
The phone is well built and I have no problems whatsoever with it. IR face unlock, fingerprint reader is fast and make me love the phone even more. No problems faced playing high-end games.",5
"For pubg, don't go buy this rather than buy one plus or asus or iphone.
For regular use you can buy this.
Problem is it heats so much and then lags too much.",1
I bought this mobile for brother it's excellent and affordable price too..I bought 6gb ram rosso red colour..and it's looks stunning..worth for the money I have spent,5
"Great phone overall. But the camera is literally the worst I have seen till date. Performance is top notch but if you are photo holic person, you are definitely not going to like it.",4
Exchange refused by buyer,1
Very good and even relevant today. You all are already know the specifications. Camera quality is too good.,5
¬†Super product ever,5
Good phone bought again for my wife,5
Review after one year of usage..still a beast.,5
I am using it from last 10 months and still it runs like a bull. You can only compare this with one plus 6. Hope Xiaomi will soon launch its flagship next model looking forward to it.,5
"Overall verygood product based on my needs ..camera , battery , gaming etc r well performed..",4
"The newcomer in 2018, the best budget flagship phone, just the big notch looking ocquered but overall this phone is the best phone in 2018 as F1 on poco by xaomi.",5
"Reviewing after using of one month this phone is best on this value i purchased this phone duaring sale and it has come around RS.14000
I am very happy using this phone and is best.",4
I like this product to much because gaming on poco f1 is beast & battery last upto 1 to 2 day* *(usual uses like calls & chating) anyway buy this product I like it,5
I think this is sick phone not for gaming only for chatting its good this mobile is waste for gaming,2
What is the great phone... Everything is there what you expect.,5
I bought this poco f1 on last week. At that time their is no problem for this phone. But now it shows screen bleefing issue. What will i do????,4
In sale... Only 15999...one of the most valuable phone,4
"Awesome phone made by xiaomi..
Superfast processor. But please provide ontime update of android versions & also lookinto the build quality..over all am setisfy with this brand.",5
Value for money,5
"Satisfied:
Battery-90%
Camera-85%
Fingerprint-100%
Face unlock-80%
Game experience-100%
Overall a good mobile-90%",5
Still better than other phones in this range.,5
The phone has zero resistance to water. Even little exposure to rain caused short circuiting in its motherboard and display. The phone is of no use thereafter.,1
"1. Fingerprint superfast
2. Face unlock also great
3. Battery life :- more than 1 day

"It's a Fake product. You can clearly see in the images, look at the logo in the image. Dont buy it.",1
mobile is very slow in functioning,1
"There are too many good technical reviews out there. So this review is from a budget conscious user who wanted a powerful processor that can sustain for at least 2 years without any major slow down.

Picked this phone for 13.5k - 128 GB.

Pros which are ignored/not spoken often by others:

1. Ability to make the notch disappear and yet use the real estate space on either sides of the camera to show battery, signal and timings (Check photo)
2. Fairly slim phone though it houses a 4k mAh battery (but for those with small hands, this is still quite a large one)
3. Raise to wake combined with face unlock combination is the deadliest I've ever seen off any phones. Even in full darkness.
4. Unlike the Pixel whose camera is terrific, this camera captures bokeh with some wide angle ability which is terrific. The Pixel zooms a little and therefore, the portrait does not have much of the environment in which one is in.
5. While I like Pixel's camera and the overall outcome but when it comes to human faces, Poco does a better job in showing the face better without much skin smoothening
6. For someone who is just using the phone for communication and some bit of social media and no games, this phone easily lasts the whole day.
7. Camera mode has complete manual settings which even Pixel does not give
8. Fast charger bundled in

Pros, again from a average user point of view and not high end users who wanted NFC

1. Battery percentage does not show in the notification section unless you update the OS
2. If you update the OS, you lose the ability to hide the notch without bringing the whole screen lower
(updated as of Dec 2019, with the latest OS update, this issue is taken care off.)
3. Body is fragile, heard many friends developing cracks in the phones easily, so good cover required, which projects to the front side, to safeguard the front glass also. Such guards are available for Rs. 500 /-
4. No wide angle camera, which of course is a new thing in 2019.
5. Feels slightly bulky if you are someone who prefer the 6"" phones and the protective case, this is definitely bulky!
6. System updates about new software cannot be dismissed from the notification section, they will be there until the phone eventually dies or you update (kind of making you force update the OS) - Check 2nd photo
7. Biggest drawback, Whatsapp Business (second whatsapp account on the same phone does not give out sound based notifications). That's a disappointment and this happened after the latest OS Pie update.",4
"I placed an order for 8gb/256gb Poco F1 Graphite Black (Armoured Edition)..and when the product arrived, the receipt showed 8gb/256gb as ordered. However, when I checked the phone specifications it was a 6gb ram phone.",1
"Never ever think about buying this phone..in case u want to be mentally harassed then go ahead ..horrible touch issues..I ordered a phone and it has issues that I can't even properly use my phone so laggy, jittery, ghost touches, screen freeze , I ordered replacement and found same issues..
I will suggest you to buy newly launched phones instead of any older phone with issues just because of its cheap Price. I learnt a valuable lesson. And I can't stressed it out more NEVER EVER THINK ABOUT BUYING THIS PHONE",1
"Coming to the phone it has excellent specifications - a beautiful 6.18"" Full HD display, Snapdragon 845 chipset (2018 flagship processor), 6GB LPDDR4X RAM, 128GB UFS 2.1 storage, 4000 mAh battery, IR face unlock and excellent cameras. Rosso Red looks stunning!
Excellent phone by Xiaomi and for the current price its more than value for money!
Undoubtedly the best buy under 20k if you are ok with older design especially the big notch, rear fingerprint sensor and a plain back (unless you buy the armoured edition)!",5
"¬†Update : Using Miui 11 i like the performance.

Value for money phone. Snapdragon 845 powerful processor.
Pros: Lag free performance. Camera is awesome. Fast charging, good battery backup.
Cons : Found some ghost touch issue when the screen is moist.

If you find this review helpful then hit the helpful button to motivate me for writing more reviews in future.",5
"Poco F1 looks really good. Light weight but feels and looks premium. Screen quality is awesome. It definitely feels very fragile so make sure to get a solid back cover and a tempered glass for protection.

Battery life is amazing. I didn't charge it for 1 full day and it was still at 50%. It takes a short time to get charged using a fast charger.

Speakers are loud and sound good. Fingerprint scanner, face unlock is super fast. But unreliable. Sometimes it doesn't open up.

The volume rockers are in an odd position. If you are holding your phone its difficult to adjust volume and sometimes it gets pressed by mistake.

Auto brightness setting doesn't work intuitively. It can't figure out the best brightness for day to night so I have disabled it.

Camera quality is really pathetic. For this price, I really expect an excellent camera. But I was disappointed.

Photos are overly bright. They are too sharp and over focused. They don't look natural. And skin lightening, brightening, whitening, smoothening is done and we have no choice to change it. So selfies look yellowish and too photoshopped. I personally don't prefer this, I like natural looking selfies.

I downloaded an app called Adobe Light room. The pics taken by this app are very natural, look pretty amazing and are very detailed. The camera performance improved a lot with this app. If you like natural looking selfies with detail then download Adobe Lighthouse or try out any other 3rd party apps.

Phone sometimes becomes slow, which is actually surprising to me.

Overall, performance is good, value for money phone. I got it on the Amazon Festival sale for Rs. 18,000 and for this price I'm happy but if you want an amazing camera, then look for newer phones that offer better camera quality.

Poco fone F1 is a powerful, future proof smartphone and at this price it's an excellent choice.",5
"Phonereally has lots of issues with no way to work around them aside from fundamental layoffs like build quality. Even after updating to latest version of software 10.3.8 I am facing serious problems as mentioned below:

1. There is a known multi touch issue with this device when you put 2 fingers and then introduce a third finger near the first two even after  moving away 3 touch points the third one remains intact means it is ghost touch.

2. Phone display is of cheap quality considering for how much this phone was sold originally when it was manufactured (Dec 2018) , when typing it gives serious lag because touch is faulty you will notice it if you try to type faster and this issue is even recognised by Alvin Tse on twitter but since it is hardware issue it can't be solvef through OS updates.

3. Battey Drainage. The phone battery drains very quickly for being a 4000 mAh, you can found this issue too mentioned and recognised many times in Miui forum. Still after all the updates no fix is there. It is annoying.

4. Bad speaker quality, speakers are not adequately loud to my liking.

Only 2 stars, one for camera and one for big screen.",2
Still best phone under this price range in terms of performance. Looks doesn't matters,5
"Before buying , I tried to contact the seller multiple times to confirm the manufacturing date of the phone, seller never bothered to reply.
Then amazon customer care(they don't care) assured me that in case I get an older manufactured unit, I will be allowed a refund.
Unfortunately decided to trust him, and go ahead with the purchase(big mistake!)

Received the OLD stock (November 2018). In case anyone is wondering what is the problem with that is, POCO F1's old stock came with defective touchscreens with all sorts of problems like ghost touches, screen becoming unresponsive and not responding to touch etc.

All the return options on the amazon website were telling to call a number. Apparently, it was amazon's 'technical support'. They said that in my case refund is an absolute no no! I can only go for replacement which is not valid in my case!

So, basically I am stuck with this hunk of junk and amazon is like, ""wasn't our fault!!""

How about, Mentioning the Manufacturing date on the product page!??
How about, not feeding wrong information to the customers before purchase? and this is the best customer care?

I would recommend everyone looking at this phone to avoid this like the plague!",1
Perfect device to get at this price... The best flagship performance in this price segment .... I am an old user of poco f1 and it didn't made me feel that i have got a bad one... Even once it didn't... I play heavy games and use it heavily throughout my whole day.. And still its battery manages .... To give a wonderful experience... Camera quality is also awesome..... All rounder at this price the killer.... Phone,5
"In 2019 there were a lot of phones with great megapixels, it may at first appear that Poco is too old but 13 MP with gcam 6.2 or 7.1 will on par with them. Sure you can't get that level of details but in day to day life you won't even need them.

Value for money because of huge discount by Xiaomi (though you'll get a year old stock , maybe Xiaomi don't make new Poco anymore)",5
"This is the worst phone I bought ever. Since the 1st day having problem to connect applications over wifi network. Sometime on mobile data too. Internet speed on this phone is very slow on same network or same wifi connection in another phone working properly but this phone has some issues of connectivity. Already visited MI customer care 3 or 4 times. They are just updating the software. All the time I have to take the data backup and load everything again. It's very long and irritating process. The quality of the product is very poor. I don't think that they have any quality control department.
My suggestion please don't buy this kind of phone. It was my big mistake Rs 18k gone to the drain. This was my 1st MI product and very disappointed with the quality.",1
"Recommend: The request to do not buy this phone because immediately drains the battery and long time taken to recharges battery. Its only display fast charge but its takes 1 hour & 55 minutes plus (almost 2 hours) fully charged.
Also order this phone in 1-Oct-19 & its box manufacturing is Oct-18. Its means 1 year old mobile sending to customer.",1
"Its still the Best mobile under 18k according to me as it's:
‚û°Ô∏è Back Camera Quality is just amazing, with Gcam it only increases manifolds.
‚û°Ô∏è Phone's light-weight considering 4000mAh Battery.
‚û°Ô∏è Front camera Quality with stock camera is just awesome it makes you forget that ugly notch.
‚û°Ô∏è Fingerprint & IR Blaster make Unlocking Blazingly fast.
‚û°Ô∏è Performance i don't need to say anything
PUBG by default runs on High Settings & supports upto ULTRA settings.
‚û°Ô∏è Got 3 updates back2back on same day on new mobile. Currently on 10.3.7
‚§µÔ∏è Only problem I currently face is battery drainage, many users saying its in this update only & It will improve in next update.

Thanks amazon for providing 2 day delivery.
Got it at 14k effectively in GIFS...",5
"Yeah, there are bugs in software over here and there, for eg one of the basics thing in smart phone is to show notification with icon in the notification bar which most of the time doesn't work. Widevine L1 certification problem is now resolved. Camera performance and battery life is more than adequate.
Although body is plastic, but it doesn't look cheap or fancy, it's good.
Yes, I do expect a better build quality and they should use metal next time for better heat dissipation. Atleast I expect a metal frame at this price tag.",5
"On of the best in class.
It is excellent device, for everyday use specially for gaming, videos etc. Little heavy due to large battery size.
It is fast charger 18w
Sound quality is good
Camera is same to other Mobile in class. Possibly need software update to improve on same.
It has 3mm headphone jack
Splash resistant ( I dropped in. Bucket still working good ) in has 854 SD approx 2.8 GZ
All other are using 7th gen processor.",4
"I took this phone after comparing with OnePlus7. Features wise both look similar on paper. However below are differences.
1. While it has Snap dragon 845 processor it lags and  becomes unresponsive at times. Most of the time it works fine.
2. Main camera quality is good. Selfie camera quality is average.
3. Since it's screensize is small don't assume this to be light weight. It feels heavier than expected.  OnePlus7 with bigger screen feels light as weight is evenly distributed and spread across with width.
4. Screen glass is outside the phone which adds to the thickness of the phone.

Overall a good phone for normal users with reasonable RAM.
Don't ever compare this with OnePlus. If you plan to buy OnePlus stop looking at this and go for that.",4
"Shifted from Samsung Galaxy S7
Got at ‚Çπ11.5 k after all the discount

What I Missed from S7 to this phone, screen quality, camera

Pros
MIUI always
Flagship processor
Possibility of future updates
Price
Great developer community support

Cons
Bleeding screen
Low loud speaker
Lots of bloatwares

Screen 3.5/5
Speed 5/5
Camera 3.5/5
Signal strength 4.5/5
Battery 4.5/5
Form factor 3.5/5",4
Everything about this phone will impress you if you buy one. But I got a year old stock and my personally suggest you to unlock your device and flash pixel experience ROM for butter smooth experience. I felt miui to be bit lagy.,4
"This is just a beast in such a low price range. Will not talk much about specification; as a normal user below are the points worth metioning:
Super fast user experience
Good screen resolution
Super battery. On my minimal usage it lasted 2 and half days.
Camera decent enough for day to day photography.
No heating problem.
Fast fingerprint scanner and face unlock(works in dark as well).
Dislikes:
Sometime screen doesn't respond well.
Notification not visible due to notch but you can get used to it.
Screen gets scratches easily so use screen guard for sure.

Overall its worth buying in 2019 in this price range.",5
Everything is nice in this range. Camera is also good but the pictures that it takes are much more smooth than real which makes it something down. Overall hdr mode portrait mode everything is as expected. Gaming is also good in this device. Pubg cod etc types of game could run in smooth and extream. It support hdr with high frame rate but it heats your phone a lot and drains battery 2 times faster than normal. Battery is quite decent. Fast charging. I get my phone charged from 0 to 100 in just 1;30 hrs. So overall phone is nice and in this price range it's a beast. I got this phone for 10k during amazon sale.,4
"I purchased this for gaming...and the points i have divided into pros n cons

PROs.
1.Price
2.Ram and storage
3.Performance
4.Battery
5.Face unlock
6.Display

Cons
1.Low light camera
2.Videography
3.Charging time(0-100% 2hrs 5min)which is slow compared to realme and oppo VOOC
4.Gorilla glass 3 (5 should have been great)
5.No AMOLED display( LCD is good but AMOLED should have been the best out there)
6.Some bugs here and there, Software is good but not best.",4
"Our 2nd phone from Xiaomi, other one being Mi 6 pro. Seems they make poor quality devices and software.
1. Phone's network connectivity is poor, frequently presents as switched off for incoming calls.

2. Many bugs in the MiUI, not a good user experience as well. Issues like keypad typing without touching, missing launcher app tray, and many more.

3. They collect too much personal data, and show too many ads on phone.

Camera quality is average, battery life is fine.",1
Great value for money !! Gifted it to my father. Its fairly simple to understand and is very fast in day to day operation,5
Too much satisfied with the quality in this price.,5
"Got armoured edition 8gb ram,256gb rom cheap....what more one could wish for....awesome phone",5
Happy with Phone so far. No issues. It could be better priced as it‚Äôs on a verge of discontinued. This is reported on forums. Plus other brands with similar specs are lower priced.,4
"Op phone, first i got a defective phone which had my hopes down on poco i thought this is how all poco phones performed i tried  everything to get a refund instead of replacement but i could only get replacement after 2days i received  new phone that is yeasterday i
The first thing i did was update the phone to the latest before anything else then i,changed my phone to 100 percentage now my phone is rocking a brand new miui11 with any sort of issue at all. So i recommend to do all the updates before u enter you personal details and change it to 100 Percent so that the battery may calibrate properly.",5
"Excellent Mobile
I ordered this mobile for my friend but iam using this mobile since last 10 months
Games
Camera
Battery life

Finally for 16k outstanding performance mobile
If you want looks and design check out other mobiles",4
Wow what a phone heavy graphics inbuilt in this mobile game monster like bigger games awesome smooth and power long life you are a games lover go for itüí™,5
"I have purchased it in Sale.. It costed me Rs. 14000/-
In this price range it is the best phone u can get..
Super Fast Performance..
Camera is great..
Battery life is excellent..
I totally recommend over all other phone in this price range..",5
If ur looking for tuff & gaming phone then go for pocco after 1 year of lauch also I prefervto purchase this device coz what feature it offers which no other phone is offering in that budget. Ruff& tuff,5
"Overall the product is okay.
But quick charger is not functional
It takes around 1.5 or 2hrs for complete charge.
Some times i am facing delay after software update",3
"Great Phone at this price tag.
Great deal by Amazon and Xiomi.

Thanks for both.

I recommend it to all who want a great product for a reasonable price.",5
What do you expect from 20K midrange. Actually it is budgetary flagship phone. Throw any app or game on it and it will give 110% of it.  Using Gcam and believe me. The SD 845 is so snappier that Gcam photos rendering  and image quality is at par. Go for it,5
"Nice camera value for money. No hang still after buying for 20 days. I play pubg and call of duty.
they must concetrate on android updates  then releasing new phones or miui updates
No ads like other MI mobiles thanks for that in miui updates üôè",5
Really nice mobile Snapdragon processor work really fine but one advice if you have good budget and have in money then go for k20 Pro because of its large screen and better look,5
The best value for money phone. You cant get a better processor than this at this price. You can check the whole market. Just go for it.,5
"Phone is great no doubt but lacking in their on miui software...there should be stock android software.
I am using third party launcher app because inbuilt view is not good and some other feature also not good in miui version.",4
This phone is at great after the price been downed to 16k officially with Cashback of 1k. Camera is superb with portrait mode and ram management is awesome nevertheless they should upgrade it with fast charging and Super amoled.,4
"Awsome phone, no one can beat this phone at this price point (14999).
Dual camera is good at age of quad camera.
Photos are good and decent in decent light.
Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 has grownd breaking performance.
Dilivery is on time, one day delivery in prime",5
"Finger print quite fast, camera quality is superb, also battery life is also good.

I mainly bought this because of super 845SD with great camera & long battery life.",5
Over all the product is good & value for money as you will not get any other phone in this configuration @ such price....only lag found is when we play any  video & if we pause it in between then that video has to be restarted again,4
"This is first time i.e Super mobile at this cost,845 proceser, after usage it is best one,I have used 1500 or more mobiles from starting wire less technology.",5
Everything is good but the tough is too sensitive that even it responds to the earphone wire.. camera is good and battery life too.. nothing more special features same as the MI phone but with higher specifications..if you need camera quality better to go with oppo f11..,3
"You can easily feel the Power &  Performance of this Phone I don't want to elaborate just got for it !
Only demerit i have felt so far is its weight distribution !",5
Phone is good but little difficult to operate as compare to oppo my previous phone.,5

"Bought it last year from flipkart when it was launched just because it has 845 snapdragon chipset and since then I found no issues. Its better than any phone of any brand within 30k range and even above that in some cases. It's better to go for this device instead of going colorful low performing oppo vivo samsung devices.
Here are my ratings for its features
Camera 11 out of 10
Performance 11 out of 10
Battery backup 10 out of 10
Regular updates 10 out of 10
Build quality 8 out of 10. Just use good quality screen protector and back case then there will not be any issues. It fell from my hand for atleast 10 times in last 1 year and believe me there is not a single scratch or any kind of software/hardware issues I faced.

I ordered same phone for my friend after 3 months I bought it and he is also very happy with it.

Just remember one thing while purchasing any smart device that always give Processor more preference than RAM. Good processor with 4GB of RAM is much much better than low end processor with 12GB of RAM.",5
"The Best of the best phone.
The Beast is real.
845 processor. This is the foundation of the phone. No need to mention anything else.
Those who are not much aware of electronics as a domain. Please understand, Processor is the machine that defines performance of the phone.
Secondly, All components in the phone are compatible with each other in a best possible way. It reduces heating and heat loss. Improves efficiency to the great extent. This phone is so efficient, you can practically do heavy tasks and Work on this phone easily.
Completely Happy... Worth the money.
I purchased at high price, as it was just launched that time. Right now its so affordable.",5
17999 in mi store so why 1000 extra pay on Amazon??,1
Bought Armoured edition 8/256 GB approx a year and half back... excellent phone.... what else you want from a phone? Am fully satisfied and hope using it till it‚Äôs last breath.... good job Xiaomi...üëçüèª,5

Trusty i love it,5
"It's the 3rd month so far I'm using & I must say it is living up to it's reputation outstandingly. After switching to MIUI 11 it has gone even further to the performance levels. All high end android games are running as smooth as butter. Fast launching of apps will make you buy another mi phone for your loved ones. Go for it, it's not 1 year old model , rather at least 2 years younger then other phones in this price range.",5
