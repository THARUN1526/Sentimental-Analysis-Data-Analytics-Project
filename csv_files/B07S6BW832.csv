Super And its really SMART phone,5
Price does not justify the features. No Dolby Atoms in 20K phone. Could have given Snapdragon 712 at this price. Camera colours are very Saturated. SAmoled when compared with Samsung phones is mediocre. Bought it from market. Vivo could have done lot better for the price they are asking for. Its a OK buy.,3
Nice phone,4
"THIS IS A WONDERFUL  DEVICE OF VIVO. I LIKES THE SHAPE AND DESIGN OF CAMERA IT IS WONDERFUL. IT'S DISPLAY IS ALSO BEST. IT'S PROCESSOR  IS GOOD.
IT'S BATTERY IS LONG LASTING. REST OF THE THINGS ARE BETTER.",5
Just go for it. Super AMOLED screen is too good. Battery back is surprising good. Charges phone fast(1.5hr). Fingers print sensor works smoothly. Camera quality is also decent enough. Trust me the proccessor is not a problem if you're not gamer. It's 8gb ram is enough for daily routine uses and don't make a problem at all. I must say battery backup is surprising.,5
Wonderfull mobile,4
Good,5
"Worst mobile . Over price .
Camera is very poor . Selfie is not 32mp Only 16mp .
Portrait function not suitable work .
Compare oppo mobile is best one ...
Don't buy these kind of worthless product . And shopper or salesman's are liar .

Worst product at this price. Rear camera is not good. Processor is outdated. 10K phone have such processor. can't play PUBG smoothly. 1 star given for the design and front camera. only two card slots available. that means if you use one slot for memory card then only one sim card you can use. fell like hell..,1
"Hi Sir/Madam,
This is my first experience with Vivo products, I am not happy with the product cameras front and rear, when I snap pics of displays led Video walls both front and rear cameras are flickering it's not stable and clear, even in slow motion it's flickering.
Very bad experience.",1

Wrost mobile from vivo ...don't buy.....Amazon price 19990 market price only 15999 mathura,1
"Worst product I have ever purchased,too much hanging problem which was not excepted, this phone is very slow,I don't understand how come a phone so slow when it has 8gb RAM, and the processor is alos good. Worthless product from VIVO.",1
Processors very very bad... camera is good,1
For the price this phone is selling only an idiot would buy this one. The processor is snapdragon 665 which is slow af compared to what other phones are offering these days,1
Only battery issue not last as normal use 12 hour,3
"Every thing is perfect. S Amoled screen, camera features, Jovi features, battery backup etc.

A bit over priced. Ideal price - upto17K max",4

This is my 3rd vivo after V17pro n V17...I must say S1 pro has a unique design and load with some fabulous features...I gift this to my wife n she loved it...delivery was quick before time...,5
Waste for it's price and quality of the camera,1
I like,5
I like it nice to have this mobile,5
This is a better device when compared with to other devices of this price range. The finger print sensor on the screen has  much slower response when compared to the traditional ones on the rear end of a device. The device offers a smooth performance every time. Gaming has been quite good (pubg in optimum settings). Battery capacity is ok when compared with the performance it delivers. Overall agood phone for anyone who doesn't want to play GTA 5 on this phone.,5
This phone was good but battery was dead too fast among this all are good.,5
camera quality excellent...,5
