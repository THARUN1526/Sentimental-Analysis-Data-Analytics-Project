Best camera,5
Exchange offer,5
Camera is too bad and very bad customer service,1
I look for specifications instead of looks and I have to say that it is good in both look and specifications.,4
"Best camera in this price segment
Battery backup is good",5
"As far as I checked there is no complaint about the phone, and Amazon delivery is also great, but the product is pre opened, as shown in the pics the seal is white but realme comes with black seal with yellow text and the whole box should be wrapped in white plastic, which this box doesn't. Phone look fine and I dont want to go through the hassle of replacement, so iam keeping the device. But I would have liked a new box.",3
battery is not good. But charging is fast. redmi note 7 pro is better,4
"It's been more than a month now since I have been using this phone and I am very much satisfied with the performance.
Pros:
1. Decent battery life, almost 1 day battery life with heavy usage.
2. No overheating problem.
3. 48MP rear camera does a great job, especially portrait and night mode.
4. Front Camera is also decent.
5. Processor is nice. I can play PUBG in highest graphic setting without experiencing a single lag.
6. Look wise is also different.
Cons:
1. Slightly heavy
2. Transferring of media is little bit difficult from old phone since default app doesn't work properly.
3. Interface could have been more user friendly.",5
Phone is very good.cam quality should be enhanced more.,4
"Nice Camera and Battery Backup...
Super Vooc Charging",5
"Good till now üëç, has been using for 1 month",4
"Looks good and slim but the processor is very slow, slow response to touch. I would suggest not to buy realme 5 pro.. Better go for other brand like redmi, Samsung and other for same price.",1
"Superb Mobile. Simply awesome. Just arrived few minutes back. After using the 2 minutes all features and mobile speed, capacity awesome. Thank you Amazon. Love it and Love you.",5
"It's wonderful and I had great experience by using this android mobile and one thing I really want to share something the vooc charger it's getting damn good by greeting 0 to 100 percent in 1.20 hour especially first 50 percent is getting charge in 30 mins.finally gaming experience Vera level 712 SD processor I love it get this mobile and get winner winner chicken dinner every time in pubg ...........
This review is post on Feb 4 20 I'm using this mobile for more than one month it's awesome.",5
Excellent experience with this mobile as it has enhanced acceleration for gaming due to it's processor and lightening fast charging. I Love this product as it's value for money. But minimum accessories like hear phones are to be added with this item.,5
Superb,4
very  good,5
"I used the phone for 1 month, till now there has been no problems. Playing games is very smooth and there has not been any heating issues. Playing pubg is smooth and graphics can go up to hd till now but may go higher later.
The things I didn't like was battery life. 4035mAh is just OK. It's not that good but it's not that bad also. The camera is also good even though the camera UI is really bad. The fast charger is superb. The phone gets fully charged from 0 to 100 in 1 hour and 20 minutes. I am not a fan of color is so I don't like the UI that much but I think the upcoming realme  UI much better.",4
"I received this Phone 1 week back.this phone is good under this price.we can handle this Phone in easy way.phone touch screen is very smooth.after updating to android 10version handling easily.
And the battery pack up is better using 12hours.with in 1hour 10min charging full.
And finally camera quality also good 48mp and night mode also good.you can buy this Phone",4

"Let's go with a detail.....
1. Camera.
Best in daylight...video's are awesome...plus I got update of wide-angle video shooting which is very good....night mode works decent... misses on detail...(pics attached)
2.performance...
I have 4gb;; 64gb varient... played pubg for 2to 3days...works very smooth...(only 2to 3days because IAM noobüòÖüòÖ ).
.
I mean no lag or anything everything runs smoothly...
3. Battary and charging speed....
One word...sexy.... charging speed is mind-blowing...believe me it's best and battery backup is also good don't see the other reviews I used it (I'll attach pic)...
4...worth the Price???
I think yes because you're getting good camera, performance, battery backup.....ithink it's sufficient...I love this product...",5
"Real battery backup is 5 hours.
Need to charge twice a day but vooc charger can counter this drawback.
Except this everything is acceptable.",4
Ultimate performer. Loving it.,5
"I am disappointed with the product ..with in two weeks the display gone,at that time in India lock down announced ,so there is no option to me to intimate to you..So now what I have to do,the phone is not switching ON,almost display gone..waste of real me products..why amazon encouraging these Cheap quality phones..almost I purchase branded products in amazon.I didnt face any issue now am facing issue with Realme..So show me an alternative for this product.",1
Selfie camera is too bad....high white balance‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è.... back cam is not48mp but superb...display is super... heating-when play games like pubg...easy to use...battery life more to improve,3
"Camera quality is amazing. Finger print scanner,face detection perfect. Assist ball feature very useful. Charges very fast. Amazon delivery is as per schedule. But I request Amazon people to make a neat invoice in A4size sheet or at least A5 with neat printing. It is worth buying.",5
chinese phone for chinese people,1
One of the fabulous mobile...the display and the style is just superb...ü•∞ Loved the most....but the only one thing is the data goes Soo fast ki after seeing some videos or other things it drains ...I think it's just becozz of full clear clarity,4
Very bad heating hard during pubg paly,1
I'm not at all satisfied vth this product. Calls are getting disconnected frequently..not even 5minutes I am able to talk properly.. sound is another issue...it's not clear.it can b smooth.,5
Camera is very bad post proccesing is suck and Ui Also instead this is best smartphone under 12k,4
Worst phone due to its battery drainage and also heating prblm... Camera was good whn the product purchased bt after update grains are occurred on the video and photo....,2

All in all a good phone with great specs.,5
"There are Sony IMX camera sensors in the front and back of the phone.

This is a better replacement for an iPhone SE than a Samsung phone (I had used Samsung phones prior to the purchase of my 22 month old iPhone SE).

I may purchase more RealMe phones in the future if they continue to use multiple Sony IMX camera sensors on their phones!!!",5
It is very mobile and the result of the camera is also huge.... super Mobile üëçüëç,5
Very good,5
